Aaron Burr:
How does a bastard, orphan, son of a whore and a
Scotsman, dropped in the middle of a forgotten
Spot in the Caribbean by providence, impoverished, in squalor
Grow up to be a hero and a scholar?

John Laurens:
The ten-dollar Founding Father without a father
Got a lot farther by working a lot harder
By being a lot smarter
By being a self-starter
By fourteen, they placed him in charge of a trading charter

Thomas Jefferson:
And every day while slaves were being slaughtered and carted
Away across the waves, he struggled and kept his guard up
Inside, he was longing for something to be a part of
The brother was ready to beg, steal, borrow, or barter

James Madison:
Then a hurricane came, and devastation reigned
Our man saw his future drip, dripping down the drain
Put a pencil to his temple, connected it to his brain
And he wrote his first refrain, a testament to his pain

Burr:
Well, the word got around, they said, "This kid is insane, man."
Took up a collection just to send him to the mainland
"Get your education, don't forget from whence you came, and
The world's gonna know your name. What's your name, man?"

Alexander Hamilton:
Alexander Hamilton
My name is Alexander Hamilton
And there's a million things I haven't done
But just you wait, just you wait...

Eliza Hamilton:
When he was ten his father split, full of it, debt-ridden
Two years later, see Alex and his mother bed-ridden
Half-dead sittin' in their own sick, the scent thick

Full Company except Hamilton (whispering):
And Alex got better but his mother went quick

George Washington (Company):
Moved in with a cousin, the cousin committed suicide
Left him with nothin' but ruined pride, something new inside
A voice saying, "Alex, you gotta fend for yourself."
He started retreatin' and readin' every treatise on the shelf

Burr (Company):
There would've been nothin' left to do
For someone less astute
He would've been dead or destitute
Without a cent of restitution
Started workin', clerkin' for his late mother's landlord
Tradin' sugar cane and rum and all the things he can't afford
Scammin' for every book he can get his hands on
Plannin' for the future see him now as he stands on (ooh...)
The bow of a ship headed for a new land
In New York you can be a new man

Company (Hamilton):
In New York you can (just you wait) be a new man
In New York you can (just you wait) be a new man
In New York you can be a new man

Women: In New York

Men: New York

Hamilton: Just you wait!

Company:
Alexander Hamilton (Alexander Hamilton)
We are waiting in the wings for you (waiting in the wings for you)
You could never back down
You never learned to take your time!
Oh, Alexander Hamilton (Alexander Hamilton)
When America sings for you
Will they know what you overcame?
Will they know you rewrote the game?
The world will never be the same, oh

Burr:
The ship is in the harbor now
See if you can spot him 
Another immigrant
Comin' up from the His enemies destroyed his rep
America forgot him

Mulligan/Madison and Lafayette/Jefferson:
We fought with him

Laurens/Philip:
Me? I died for him

Washington:
Me? I trusted him

Eliza and Angelica and Peggy/Maria:
Me? I loved him

Burr:
And me? I'm the damn fool that shot him

Company:
There's a million things I haven't done
But just you wait!

Burr:
What's your name, man?

Company:
Alexander Hamilton!

Company:
1776. New York City.

Hamilton:
Pardon me. Are you Aaron Burr, sir?

Burr:
That depends. Who's asking?

Hamilton:
Oh, well, sure, sir
I'm Alexander Hamilton, I'm at your service, sir
I have been looking for you

Burr:
I'm getting nervous

Hamilton:
Sir…
I heard your name at Princeton. I was seeking an accelerated course of study when I got sort of out of sorts with a buddy of yours. I may have punched him. It's a blur, sir. He handles the financials?

Burr:
You punched the bursar

Hamilton:
Yes!
I wanted to do what you did. Graduate in two, then join the revolution. He looked at me like I was stupid, I'm not stupid.
So how'd you do it? How'd you graduate so fast?

Burr:
It was my parents' dying wish before they passed

Hamilton:
You're an orphan. Of course! I'm an orphan
God, I wish there was a war!
Then we could prove that we're worth more
Than anyone bargained for…

Burr:
Can I buy you a drink?

Hamilton:
That would be nice

Burr:
While we're talking, let me offer you some free advice
Talk less

Hamilton:
What?

Burr:
Smile more

Hamilton:
Ha

Burr:
Don't let them know what you're against or what you're for

Hamilton:
You can't be serious

Burr:
You wanna get ahead?

Hamilton:
Yes

Burr:
Fools who run their mouths off wind up dead

Laurens:
Yo yo yo yo yo!
What time is it?

Laurens/Lafayette/Mulligan:
Show time!

Burr:
Like I said…

Laurens:
Show time! Show time! Yo!
I'm John Laurens in the place to be!
A two pints o' Sam Adams, but I'm workin' on three, uh!
Those redcoats don't want it with me!
'Cause I will pop chick-a pop these cops 'til I'm free!

Lafayette:
Oui oui, mon ami, je m'appelle Lafayette!
The Lancelot of the revolutionary set!
I came from afar just to say "Bonsoir!"
Tell the King "Casse toi!" Who's the best?
C'est moi!

Mulligan:
Brrrah brraaah! I am Hercules Mulligan
Up in it, lovin' it, yes I heard ya mother said, "Come again?"

Lafayette and Laurens:
Ayyyyy

Mulligan:
Lock up ya daughters and horses, of course
It's hard to have intercourse over four sets of corsets…

Lafayette:
Wow

Laurens:
No more sex, pour me another brew, son!
Let's raise a couple more…

Laurens/Lafayette/Mulligan:
To the revolution!

Laurens:
Well, if it ain't the prodigy of Princeton college!

Mulligan:
Aaron Burr!

Laurens:
Give us a verse, drop some knowledge!

Burr: 
Good luck with that: you're takin' a stand
You spit. I'mma sit. We'll see where we land

Lafayette/Mulligan:
Boooo!

Laurens:
Burr, the revolution's imminent. What do you stall for?

Hamilton:
If you stand for nothing, Burr, what'll you fall for?

Mulligan/Lafayette/Laurens:
Ooh

Laurens:
Who are you?

Mulligan:
Who are you?

Lafayette:
Who are you?

Mulligan/Lafayette/Laurens:
Ooh, who is this kid? What's he gonna do?

Hamilton:
I am not throwing away my shot!
I am not throwing away my shot!
Hey yo, I'm just like my country
I'm young, scrappy and hungry
And I'm not throwing away my shot!
I'm 'a get a scholarship to King's College
I probably shouldn't brag, but dag, I amaze and astonish
The problem is I got a lot of brains but no polish
I gotta holler just to be heard
With every word, I drop knowledge!
I'm a diamond in the rough, a shiny piece of coal
Tryin' to reach my goal. My power of speech: unimpeachable
Only nineteen but my mind is older
These New York City streets get colder, I shoulder
Every burden, every disadvantage
I have learned to manage, I don't have a gun to brandish
I walk these streets famished

Laurens:
Ooh!

Hamilton:
The plan is to fan this spark into a flame
But damn, it's getting dark, so let me spell out the name
I am the

Hamilton/Lafayette/Mulligan/Laurens:
A-L-E-X-A-N-D
E-R—we are meant to be…

Hamilton:
A colony that runs independently
Meanwhile, Britain keeps shittin' on us endlessly
Essentially, they tax us relentlessly
Then King George turns around, runs a spending spree
He ain't ever gonna set his descendants free
So there will be a revolution in this century
Enter me!

Lafayette/Mulligan/Laurens:
(He says in parentheses)

Hamilton:
Don't be shocked when your history book mentions me
I will lay down my life if it sets us free
Eventually, you'll see my ascendancy

Hamilton (Laurens):
And I am not throwing away
My shot (My shot)
I am not throwing away
My shot (My shot)
Hey yo, I'm just like my country
I'm young, scrappy and hungry
And I'm not throwing away my shot (And I'm not throwing away my shot)

Hamilton/Mulligan/Laurens/Lafayette:
I am not throwing away my shot
I am not throwing away my shot
Hey yo, I'm just like my country
I'm young, scrappy and hungry
And I'm not throwing away my shot
It's time to take a shot!

Lafayette:
I dream of life without a monarchy
The unrest in France will lead to 'onarchy?
'Onarchy? How you say, how you say, oh, 'Anarchy'!
When I fight, I make the other side panicky
With my

Hamilton/Laurens/Lafayette/Mulligan:
Shot!

Mulligan:
Yo, I'm a tailor's apprentice
And I got y'all knuckleheads in loco parentis
I'm joining the rebellion 'cause I know it's my chance
To socially advance, instead of sewin' some pants!
I'm gonna take a

Hamilton/Laurens/Lafayette/Mulligan:
Shot!

Laurens:
And but we'll never be truly free
Until those in bondage have the same rights as you and me
(That's right!)
You and I. Do or die. Wait 'til I sally in
On a stallion with the first black battalion
Have another

Hamilton/Laurens/Lafayette/Mulligan:
Shot!

Burr:
Geniuses, lower your voices
You keep out of trouble and you double your choices
I'm with you, but the situation is fraught
You've got to be carefully taught:
If you talk, you're gonna get shot!

Hamilton:
Burr, check what we got
Mister Lafayette, hard rock like Lancelot
I think your pants look hot
Laurens, I like you a lot
Let's hatch a plot blacker than the kettle callin' the pot...
What are the odds the gods would put us all in one spot
Poppin' a squat on conventional wisdom, like it or not
A bunch of revolutionary manumission abolitionists?
Give me a position, show me where the ammunition is!
Oh, am I talkin' too loud?
Sometimes I get over-excited, shoot off at the mouth
I never had a group of friends before
I promise that I'll make y'all proud

Laurens:
Let's get this guy in front of a crowd

Hamilton/Laurens/Lafayette/Mulligan/Ensemble:
I am not throwing away my shot
I am not throwing away my shot
Hey yo, I'm just like my country
I'm young, scrappy and hungry
And I'm not throwing away my shot
I am not throwing away my shot
I am not throwing away my shot
Hey yo, I'm just like my country
I'm young, scrappy and hungry
And I'm not throwing away my shot

Laurens (Hamilton/Lafayette/Mulligan):
Everybody sing:
Whoa, whoa, whoa (Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!)
Hey!
Whoa! (Whoa!)
Wooh!
Whoa! (Whoa!)
Ay, let 'em hear ya!
(Yeah!)
Let's go!

Laurens (Company):
(Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!)
I said shout it to the rooftops! (Whoa!)
Said, to the rooftops! (Whoa!)
Come on!
(Yeah!)
Come on, let's go!

Laurens:
Rise up!
When you're living on your knees, you rise up
Tell your brother that he's gotta rise up
Tell your sister that she's gotta rise up

Laurens and Ensemble (Company):
When are these colonies gonna rise up?
When are these colonies gonna rise up? (Whoa!)
When are these colonies gonna rise up? (Whoa!)
When are these colonies gonna rise up? (Whoa!)
Rise up!

Hamilton:
I imagine death so much it feels more like a memory
When's it gonna get me?
In my sleep? Seven feet ahead of me?
If I see it comin', do I run or do I let it be?
Is it like a beat without a melody?
See, I never thought I'd live past twenty
Where I come from some get half as many
Ask anybody why we livin' fast and we laugh, reach for a flask
We have to make this moment last, that's plenty
Scratch that
This is not a moment, it's the movement
Where all the hungriest brothers with something to prove went.
Foes oppose us, we take an honest stand
We roll like Moses, claimin' our promised land
And? If we win our independence?
Is that a guarantee of freedom for our descendants?
Or will the blood we shed begin an endless
Cycle of vengeance and death with no defendants?
I know the action in the street is excitin'
But Jesus, between all the bleedin' 'n fightin'
I've been readin' 'n writin'
We need to handle our financial situation
Are we a nation of states? What's the state of our nation?
I'm past patiently waitin'. I'm passionately
Smashin' every expectation
Every action's an act of creation!
I'm laughin' in the face of casualties and sorrow
For the first time, I'm thinkin' past tomorrow.

Hamilton and Company:
And I am not throwing away my shot
I am not throwing away my shot
Hey yo, I'm just like my country
I'm young, scrappy and hungry
And I'm not throwing away my shot

Hamilton/Laurens/Lafayette/Mulligan (Ensemble):
We're gonna rise up! (Not throwing away my shot) Time to take a shot!
We're gonna rise up! (Not throwing away my shot) Time to take a shot!
We're gonna (Rise up! Rise up!)
It's time to take a shot! (Rise up! Rise up!)
It's time to take a shot! (Rise up!)
(Rise up!) (Woooah!)
It's time to take a shot! (Rise up!)
Take a shot! Shot! Shot!
A-yo it's time to take a shot!
Time to take a shot!
And I am not throwing away my

Company: Not throwing away my shot!

Hamilton:

Lafayette/Mulligan/Laurens:
I may not live to see our glory!

Hamilton:

Lafayette/Mulligan/Laurens:

Burr:
There's nothing rich folks love more
Than going downtown and slummin' it with the poor
They pull up in their carriages and gawk
At the students in the common
Just to watch them talk
Take Philip Schuyler: the man is loaded
Uh-oh, but little does he know that
His daughters, Peggy, Angelica, Eliza
Sneak into the city just to watch all the guys at

Burr:
Wooh! There's nothin' like summer in the city
Someone in a rush next to someone lookin' pretty
Excuse me, miss, I know it's not funny
But your perfume smells like your daddy's got money
Why you slummin' in the city in your fancy heels
You searching for an urchin who can give you ideals?

Angelica:
Burr, you disgust me

Burr:
Ah, so you've discussed me
I'm a trust fund, baby, you can trust me!

Angelica:
I've been reading Common Sense by Thomas Paine
So men say that I'm intense or I'm insane
You want a revolution? I want a revelation
So listen to my declaration:

Eliza/Angelica/Peggy:
"We hold these truths to be self-evident
That all men are created equal"

Angelica:

Seabury:
Hear ye, hear ye! My name is Samuel Seabury
And I present "Free Thoughts on the Proceedings of the Continental Congress!"
Heed not the rabble who scream revolution
They have not your interests at heart

Mulligan:
Oh my God. Tear this dude apart

Seabury:
Chaos and bloodshed are not a solution
Don't let them lead you astray
This Congress does not speak for me

Burr:
Let him be

Seabury:
They're playing a dangerous game
I pray the king shows you his mercy
For shame, for shame…

Yo!
He'd have you all unravel at the (Heed not the rabble)
Sound of screams but the (Who scream)
Revolution is comin' (Revolution, they)
The have-nots are gonna (Have not your)
Win this (Interests)
It's hard to listen to you with a straight face (At heart)
Chaos and bloodshed already haunt us (Chaos and bloodshed are not a)
Honestly, you shouldn't even talk (Solution)
And what about Boston? Look at the cost, n' all that we've lost n' you talk (Don't let them lead you astray)
About Congress?! (This Congress does not speak for me)
My dog speaks more eloquently than thee!

But strangely, your mange is the same

Hamilton:
Don't modulate the key then not debate with me!
Why should a tiny island across the sea regulate the price of tea?

Burr:
Alexander, please!

Hamilton:
Burr, I'd rather be divisive than indecisive, drop the niceties

Ensemble:
Silence! A message from the King!
A message from the King!

Full Company:
A message from the King!

King George:
You say
The price of my love's not a price that you're willing to pay
You cry
In your tea which you hurl in the sea when you see me go by
Why so sad?
Remember we made an arrangement when you went away
Now you're making me mad
Remember, despite our estrangement, I'm your man
You'll be back, soon you'll see
You'll remember you belong to me
You'll be back, time will tell
You'll remember that I served you well
Oceans rise, empires fall
We have seen each other through it all
And when push comes to shove
I will send a fully armed battalion to remind you of my love!
Da da da dat da dat da da da da ya da
Da da dat dat da ya da!
Da da da dat da dat da da da da ya da
Da da dat dat da…
You say our love is draining and you can't go on
You'll be the one complaining when I am gone...
And no, don't change the subject
'Cause you're my favorite subject
My sweet, submissive subject
My loyal, royal subject
Forever and ever and ever and ever and ever…
You'll be back like before
I will fight the fight and win the war
For your love, for your praise
And I'll love you till my dying days
When you're gone, I'll go mad
So don't throw away this thing we had
'Cause when push comes to shove
I will kill your friends and family to remind you of my love
Da da da dat da dat da da da da ya da

As a kid in the Caribbean I wished for a war
I knew that I was poor
I knew it was the only way to

Hamilton/Burr/Mulligan/Laurens/Lafayette:

If they tell my story
I am either gonna die on the battlefield in glory or

Hamilton/Burr/Mulligan/Laurens/Lafayette:

I will fight for this land
But there's only one man
Who can give us a command so we can—

Washington (Ensemble):
We are outgunned (What?)
Outmanned (What?)
Outnumbered
Outplanned (Buck, buck, buck, buck, buck!)
We gotta make an all out stand
Ayo, I'm gonna need a right-hand man (Buck, buck, buck, buck, buck!)

Washington:
Check it
Can I be real a second?
For just a millisecond?
Let down my guard and tell the people how I feel a second?
Now I'm the model of a modern major general
The venerated Virginian veteran whose men are all
Lining up, to put me up on a pedestal
Writin' letters to relatives
Embellishin' my elegance and eloquence
But the elephant is in the room
The truth is in ya face when ya hear the British cannons go…

Ensemble:
Boom!

Washington:
Any hope of success is fleeting
How can I keep leading when the people I'm
Leading keep retreating?
We put a stop to the bleeding as the British take Brooklyn
Knight takes rook, but look

Washington (Ensemble):
We are outgunned (What?)
Outmanned (What?)
Outnumbered
Outplanned (Buck, buck, buck, buck, buck!)
We gotta make an all out stand
Ayo, I'm gonna need a right-hand man (Buck, buck, buck, buck, buck!)
Incoming!

Hamilton:
They're battering down the Battery check the damages

Mulligan:
Rah!

Hamilton:
We gotta stop 'em and rob 'em of their advantages

Mulligan:
Rah!

Hamilton:
Let's take a stand with the stamina God has granted us
Hamilton won't abandon ship
Yo, let's steal their cannons

Mulligan (Company):
Shh-boom! (Boom!)

Washington:
Goes the cannon, watch the blood and the shit spray and…

Company:
Boom!

Washington:
Goes the cannon, we're abandonin' Kips Bay and…

Company:
Boom!

Washington:
There's another ship and…

Company:
Boom!

Washington:
We just lost the southern tip and…

Company:
Boom!

Washington:
We gotta run to Harlem quick, we can't afford another slip
Guns and horses giddyup
I decide to divvy up
My forces, they're skittish as the British cut the city up
This close to giving up, facing mad scrutiny
I scream in the face of this mass mutiny:
Are these the men with which I am to defend America?
We ride at midnight, Manhattan in the distance
I cannot be everywhere at once, people
I'm in dire need of assistance…

Burr:
Your excellency, sir!

Washington:
Who are you?

Burr:
Aaron Burr, Sir
Permission to state my case?

Washington:
As you were

Burr:
Sir
I was a captain under General Montgomery
Until he caught a bullet in the neck in Quebec
And well, in summary
I think that I could be of some assistance
I admire how you keep firing on the British
From a distance

Washington:
Huh

Burr:
I have some questions, a couple of suggestions on how to fight instead of fleeing west

Washington:
Yes?

Burr:
Well

Hamilton:
Your excellency, you wanted to see me?

Washington:
Hamilton, come in, have you met Burr?

Hamilton:
Yes, sir

Hamilton and Burr:
We keep meeting

Burr:
As I was saying, sir, I look forward to seeing your strategy play out

Washington:
Burr?

Burr:
Sir?

Washington:
Close the door on your way out

Hamilton:

Have I done something wrong, sir?
Washington:
On the contrary
I called you here because our odds are beyond scary
Your reputation precedes you, but I have to laugh

Hamilton:
Sir?

Washington:
Hamilton, how come no one can get you on their staff?

Hamilton:
Sir!

Washington:
Don't get me wrong, you're a young man of great renown
I know you stole British cannons when we were still downtown
Nathaniel Greene and Henry Knox wanted to hire you…

Hamilton:
To be their Secretary? I don't think so

Washington:
And why're you upset?

Hamilton:
I'm not

Washington:
It's alright, you want to fight, you've got a hunger
I was just like you when I was younger
Head full of fantasies of dyin' like a martyr?

Hamilton:
Yes

Washington:
Dying is easy, young man
Living is harder

Hamilton:
Why are you telling me this?

Washington:
I'm being honest
I'm working with a third of what our Congress has promised
We are a powder keg about to explode
I need someone like you to lighten the load. So?

Company except Hamilton:
I am not throwin' away my shot!
I am not throwin' away my shot!
Ayo, I'm just like my country
I'm young scrappy and hungry!

Hamilton:
I am not throwing away my shot!

Washington:
Son

Washington and Company:
We are outgunned, outmanned!

Hamilton:
You need all the help you can get
I have some friends. Laurens, Mulligan
Marquis de Lafayette, okay, what else?

Washington and Company:
Outnumbered, outplanned!

Hamilton:
We'll need some spies on the inside
Some King's men who might let some things slide

Hamilton (Company):
(Boom!) I'll write to Congress and tell 'em we need supplies, you rally the guys {Whoa, whoa, whoa...}
Master the element of surprise
(Boom!) I'll rise above my station, organize your information, 'til we rise to the occasion of our new nation. Sir! {Whoa, whoa, whoa...}

Ensemble:
Here comes the General!

Hamilton:
Rise up!

Laurens/Lafayette/Mulligan:
What?

Ensemble:
Here comes the General!

Hamilton/Schuyler Sisters/Women:
Rise up!

Laurens/Lafayette/Mulligan:
What?

Ensemble:
Here comes the General!

Hamilton/Schuyler Sisters:
Rise up!

Laurens/Lafayette/Mulligan:
What?

Company:
Here comes the General!

Hamilton:
What?

Washington:
And his right-hand man!

Company:
Boom!

Burr:
How does the bastard, orphan, son of a whore
Go on and on
Grow into more of a phenomenon?
Watch this obnoxious, arrogant, loudmouth bother
Be seated at the right hand of the father
Washington hires Hamilton right on sight
But Hamilton still wants to fight, not write
Now Hamilton's skill with a quill is undeniable
But what do we have in common?
We're reliable with the

All men:
Ladies!

Burr:
There are so many to deflower!

All men:
Ladies!

Burr:
Looks! Proximity to power

All men:
Ladies!

Burr:
They delighted and distracted him
Martha Washington named her feral tomcat after him!

Hamilton:
That's true!

Full Company:
1780

Burr:
A winter's ball
And the Schuyler sisters are the envy of all
Yo, if you can marry a sister, you're rich, son

Hamilton:
Is it a question of if, Burr, or which one?

Hamilton/Burr/Laurens:
Hey
Hey
Hey hey

Eliza (all women):
Oh, I do I do I do I (Hey hey hey hey)
Dooo! Hey! (Hey hey hey hey)
Oh, I do I do I do I (Hey hey hey hey)
Dooo! Boy you got me (Hey hey hey)

Eliza and women:
Helpless!
Look into your eyes, and the sky's the limit
I'm helpless!
Down for the count, and I'm drownin' in 'em

Eliza:
I have never been the type to try and grab the spotlight
We were at a revel with some rebels on a hot night
Laughin' at my sister as she's dazzling the room
Then you walked in and my heart went "Boom!"
Tryin' to catch your eye from the side of the ballroom
Everybody's dancin' and the band's top volume

Eliza and women:
Grind to the rhythm as we wine and dine

Eliza (all women):
Grab my sister and whisper, "Yo, this one's mine" (Ooh)
My sister made her way across the room to you (Ooh)
And I got nervous, thinking, "What's she gonna do?" (Ooh)
She grabs you by the arm, I'm thinkin' "I'm through" (Ooh)
Then you look back at me, and suddenly I'm...
Helpless!
Oh, look at those eyes (Look into your eyes, and the sky's the limit)
Oh! Yeah, I'm helpless, I know
(Down for the count and I'm drownin' in 'em)
(I'm helpless!)
I'm so into you, I am so into you
(Look into your eyes, and the sky's the limit)
(I'm helpless!)
I know I'm down for the count and I'm drownin' in 'em

Hamilton:
Where are you taking me?

Angelica:
I'm about to change your life

Hamilton:
Then by all means, lead the way

Eliza:
Elizabeth Schuyler
It's a pleasure to meet you

Hamilton:
Schuyler?

Angelica:
My sister

Eliza:
Thank you for all your service

Hamilton:
If it takes fighting a war for us to meet, it will have been worth it

Angelica:
I'll leave you to it

Eliza and women:
One week later

Eliza:
I'm writin' a letter nightly
Now my life gets better, every letter that you write me
Laughin' at my sister, 'cause she wants to form a harem

Angelica:
I'm just sayin', if you really loved me, you would share him

Eliza (all women):
Ha!
Two weeks later in the living room stressin' (stressin')
My father's stone-faced while you're asking for his blessin' (blessin')
I'm dying inside, as you wine and dine
And I'm tryin' not to cry 'cause there's nothing that your mind can't do (Ooh)
My father makes his way across the room to you (Ooh)
I panic for a second, thinking, "We're through" (Ooh)
But then he shakes your hand and says, "Be true" (Ooh)
And you turn back to me smiling, and I'm...
(Hey!)
Helpless!
(Look into your eyes, and the sky's the limit)
I'm helpless, hoo
(Down for the count and I'm drownin' in 'em I'm helpless!)
Yes mommy, that boy is mine
(Look into your eyes, and the sky's the limit)
(I'm helpless!)
Helpless!
Down for the count and I'm drownin' in 'em

Hamilton:
Eliza, I don't have a dollar to my name
An acre of land, a troop to command, a dollop of fame
All I have's my honor, a tolerance for pain
A couple of college credits and my top-notch brain
Insane, your family brings out a different side of me
Peggy confides in me, Angelica tried to take a bite of me
No stress, my love for you is never in doubt
We'll get a little place in Harlem and we'll figure it out
I've been livin' without a family since I was a child
My father left, my mother died, I grew up buckwild
But I'll never forget my mother's face, that was real
And long as I'm alive, Eliza, swear to God
You'll never feel so…

Hamilton (Eliza) {all women}:
{Helpless!} (I do I do I do I do!) Eliza...
{Helpless!} (I do I do I do I do!) I've never felt so
{Helpless!} (Hey, yeah, yeah!)
{Down for the count and I'm drownin' in 'em}
(Down for the count and I'm)
My life is gon' be fine 'cause Eliza's in it {Helpless!}
(I look into your eyes, and the sky's the limit)
{Helpless!}
(I'm) {Helpless!}
{Down for the count and I'm drownin' in 'em}

All women:
In New York you can be a new man
In New York you can be a new man
In New York you can be a new man

Eliza:
Helpless

Laurens:
Alright, alright. That's what I'm talkin' about!
Now everyone give it up for the maid of honor
Angelica Schuyler!

Angelica (all men) {all women}:
A toast to the groom!
(To the groom!)
(To the groom!)
{(To the groom!)}
To the bride!
{To the bride!}
(To the bride!)
{To the bride!}
From your sister
(Angelica!)
(Angelica!)
{(Angelica!)}
Who is always by your side
(By your side)
{By your side}
To your union
{(To the union!)}
{(To the revolution!)}
And the hope that you provide
(You provide!)
{(You provide!)}
May you always…
{(Always)}
Be satisfied
{(Rewind)}


Angelica:
I remember that night, I just might
Regret that night for the rest of my days
I remember those soldier boys
Tripping over themselves to win our praise
I remember that dreamlike candlelight
Like a dream that you can't quite place
But Alexander, I'll never forget the first time I saw your face
I have never been the same
Intelligent eyes in a hunger-pang frame
And when you said, "Hi," I forgot my dang name
Set my heart aflame, every part aflame
Full Company:
This is not a game…

Hamilton:
You strike me as a woman who has never been satisfied

Angelica:
I'm sure I don't know what you mean
You forget yourself

Hamilton:
You're like me
I'm never satisfied

Angelica:
Is that right?

Hamilton:
I've never been satisfied

Angelica:
My name is Angelica Schuyler

Hamilton:
Alexander Hamilton

Angelica:
Where's your family from?

Hamilton:
Unimportant
There's a million things I haven't done
but just you wait, just you wait…

Angelica:
So so so... so this is what it feels like to match wits
With someone at your level! What the hell is the catch?
It's the feeling of freedom, of seein' the light
It's Ben Franklin with a key and a kite!
You see it, right?
The conversation lasted two minutes, maybe three minutes
Everything we said in total agreement, it's
A dream and it's a bit of a dance
A bit of a posture, it's a bit of a stance
He's a bit of a flirt, but I'm 'a give it a chance
I asked about his family. Did you see his answer?
His hands started fidgeting, he looked askance?
He's penniless, he's flying by the seat of his pants
Handsome. Boy, does he know it?
Peach fuzz, and he can't even grow it!
I wanna take him far away from this place
Then I turn and see my sister's face
And she is…

Eliza:
Helpless…

Angelica:
And I know she is…

Eliza:
Helpless…

Angelica:
And her eyes are just…

Eliza:
Helpless…

Angelica:
And I realize

Angelica and Company:
Three fundamental truths at the exact same time…

Hamilton:
Where are you taking me?

Angelica:
I'm about to change your life

Hamilton:
Then by all means, lead the way

Company (except Angelica):
Number one!

Angelica:
I'm a girl in a world in which
My only job is to marry rich
My father has no sons so I'm the one
Who has to social climb for one
So I'm the oldest and the wittiest and the gossip in
New York City is insidious
And Alexander is penniless
Ha! That doesn't mean I want him any less

Eliza:
Elizabeth Schuyler. It's a pleasure to meet you

Hamilton:
Schuyler?

Angelica:
My sister

Company:
Number two!

Angelica:
He's after me 'cause I'm a Schuyler sister
That elevates his status, I'd
Have to be naïve to set that aside
Maybe that is why
I introduce him to Eliza
Now that's his bride
Nice going, Angelica, he was right
You will never be satisfied

Eliza:
Thank you for all your service

Hamilton:
If it takes fighting a war for us to meet, it will have been worth it

Angelica:
I'll leave you to it

Company:
Number three!

Angelica:
I know my sister like I know my own mind
You will never find
Anyone as trusting or as kind
If I tell her that I love him she'd be silently resigned
He'd be mine
She would say, "I'm fine."

Angelica and Company:
She'd be lying

Angelica:
But when I fantasize at night
It's Alexander's eyes
As I romanticize what might
Have been if I hadn't sized
Him up so quickly
At least my dear Eliza's his wife;
At least I keep his eyes in my life…

Angelica (all men) {all women}:
To the groom!
(To the groom!)
(To the groom!)
{(To the groom!)}
To the bride!
{To the bride!}
(To the bride!)
{To the bride!}
From your sister
(Angelica!)
(Angelica!)
{(Angelica!)}
Who is always by your side
(By your side)
{By your side}
To your union
{(To the union!)}
{(To the revolution!)}
And the hope that you provide
(You provide!)
{(You provide!)}
May you always…
{(Always)}
Be satisfied
(Be satisfied)
{Be satisfied}
(Be satisfied)
And I know
{(Be satisfied)}
(Be satisfied)
(Be satisfied)
(Be satisfied)
She'll be happy as
(Be satisfied)
(Be satisfied)
His bride
{(Be satisfied)}
And I know
(Be satisfied)
(Be satisfied)
(Be satisfied)
{Be satisfied}
He will never be satisfied
I will never be satisfied

Laurens:
I may not live to see our glory!

Mulligan/Lafayette:
I may not live to see our glory!

Laurens:
But I've seen wonders great and small

Mulligan/Lafayette:
I've seen wonders great and small

Laurens:
'Cause if the tomcat can get married

Mulligan/Lafayette:
If Alexander can get married

Laurens:
There's hope for our ass, after all!

Lafayette:
Raise a glass to freedom

Laurens/Mulligan:
Hey!
Something you will never see again!

Mulligan:
No matter what she tells you

Lafayette:
Let's have another round tonight!

Laurens:
Raise a glass to the four of us!

Lafayette/Hamilton:
Ho!

Mulligan:
To the newly not poor of us!

Laurens/Lafayette/Hamilton:
Woo!

Lafayette:
We'll tell the story of tonight

Laurens:
Let's have another round

Hamilton:
Well, if it isn't Aaron Burr

Burr:
Sir!

Hamilton:
I didn't think that you would make it

Burr:
To be sure

Mulligan/Lafayette:
Burr!

Burr:
I came to say congratulations

Mulligan:
Spit a verse, Burr!

Burr:
I see the whole gang is here

Lafayette:
You are the worst, Burr!

Hamilton:
Ignore them
Congrats to you, Lieutenant Colonel
I wish I had your command instead of manning George's journal

Burr:
No, you don't

Hamilton:
Yes, I do

Burr:
Now, be sensible
From what I hear, you've made yourself indispensable

Laurens:
Well, well, I heard
You've got a special someone on your side, Burr

Hamilton:
Is that so?

Laurens:
What are you tryin' to hide, Burr?

Burr:
I should go

Hamilton:
No, these guys should go

Lafayette:
What?

Laurens:
No!

Hamilton:
Leave us alone

Mulligan:
Man…

Hamilton:
It's alright, Burr
I wish you'd brought this girl with you tonight, Burr

Burr:
You're very kind, but I'm afraid it's unlawful, sir

Hamilton:
What do you mean?

Burr:
She's married

Hamilton:
I see

Burr:
She's married to a British officer

Hamilton:
Oh shit…

Burr:
Congrats again, Alexander
Smile more
I'll see you on the other side of the war

Hamilton:
I will never understand you
If you love this woman, go get her!
What are you waiting for?

Burr:
I'll see you on the other side of the war

Hamilton:
I'll see you on the other side of the war

Burr:
Theodosia writes me a letter every day
I'm keeping her bed warm while her husband is away
He's on the British side in Georgia
He's trying to keep the colonies in line
But he can keep all of Georgia
Theodosia, she's mine
Love doesn't discriminate
Between the sinners
And the saints
It takes and it takes and it takes
And we keep loving anyway
We laugh and we cry
And we break
And we make our mistakes
And if there's a reason I'm by her side
When so many have tried
Then I'm willing to wait for it
I'm willing to wait for it
My grandfather was a fire and brimstone preacher
But there are things that the
Homilies and hymns won't teach ya
My mother was a genius
My father commanded respect
When they died they left no instructions
Just a legacy to protect

Burr/Ensemble:
Death doesn't discriminate
Between the sinners and the saints
It takes and it takes and it takes
And we keep living anyway
We rise and we fall
And we break
And we make our mistakes
And if there's a reason I'm still alive
When everyone who loves me has died
I'm willing to wait for it (wait for it)
I'm willing to wait for it
Wait for it

Ensemble:
Wait for it
Wait for it
Wait for it

Burr:
I am the one thing in life I can control

Ensemble:
Wait for it
Wait for it
Wait for it
Wait for it

Burr:
I am inimitable
I am an original

Ensemble:
Wait for it
Wait for it
Wait for it
Wait for it

Burr:
I'm not falling behind or running late

Ensemble:
Wait for it
Wait for it
Wait for it
Wait for it

Burr:
I'm not standing still
I am lying in wait

Ensemble:
Wait
Wait
Wait

Burr:
Hamilton faces an endless uphill climb

Ensemble:
Climb
Climb
Climb

Burr:
He has something to prove
He has nothing to lose

Ensemble:
Lose
Lose
Lose
Lose

Burr:
Hamilton's pace is relentless
He wastes no time

Ensemble:
Time
Time
Time

Burr:
What is it like in his shoes?
Hamilton doesn't hesitate
He exhibits no restraint
He takes and he takes and he takes
And he keeps winning anyway
He changes the game
He plays and he raises the stakes
And if there's a reason
He seems to thrive when so few survive, then Goddamnit

Burr and Company:
I'm willing to wait for it (wait for it, wait for...)
I'm willing to wait for it...
Life doesn't discriminate
Between the sinners and the saints
It takes and it takes and it takes
And we keep living anyway
We rise and we fall and we break
And we make our mistakes
And if there's a reason I'm still alive
When so many have died
Then I'm willin' to

Eliza:
Stay alive…

Eliza/Angelica/Ensemble women:
Stay alive…

Hamilton:
I have never seen the General so despondent
I have taken over writing all his correspondence
Congress writes, "George, attack the British forces."
I shoot back, we have resorted to eating our horses
Local merchants deny us equipment, assistance
They only take British money, so sing a song of sixpence

Washington:
The cavalry's not coming

Hamilton:
But, sir!

Washington:
Alex, listen. There's only one way for us to win this
Provoke outrage, outright

Hamilton:
That's right

Washington:
Don't engage, strike by night
Remain relentless 'til their troops take flight

Hamilton:
Make it impossible to justify the cost of the fight

Washington:
Outrun

Hamilton:
Outrun

Washington:
Outlast

Hamilton:
Outlast

Washington:
Hit 'em quick, get out fast

Hamilton:
Chick-a-plao!

Washington:
Stay alive 'til this horror show is past
We're gonna fly a lot of flags half-mast

Hamilton/Laurens/Lafayette:
Raise a glass!

Mulligan:
I go back to New York and my apprenticeship

Lafayette:
I ask for French aid, I pray that France has sent a ship

Laurens:
I stay at work with Hamilton
We write essays against slavery
And every day's a test of our camaraderie and bravery

Hamilton:
We cut supply lines, we steal contraband
We pick and choose our battles and places to take a stand
And ev'ry day
"Sir, entrust me with a command"
And ev'ry day

Washington:
No

Hamilton:
He dismisses me out of hand

Hamilton (Eliza/Angelica):
Instead of me (Stay alive...)
He promotes
Charles Lee (Lee: Charles Lee)
Makes him second-in-command:

Lee:
I'm a General. Whee!

Hamilton:
Yeah. He's not the choice I would have gone with

Hamilton/Laurens/Lafayette:
He shits the bed at the Battle of Monmouth

Washington:
Ev'ryone attack!

Lee:
Retreat!

Washington:
Attack!

Lee:
Retreat!

Washington:
What are you doing, Lee? Get back on your feet!

Lee:
But there's so many of them!

Washington:
I'm sorry, is this not your speed?!
Hamilton!

Hamilton:
Ready, sir!

Washington:
Have Lafayette take the lead!

Hamilton:
Yes, sir!

Laurens:
A thousand soldiers die in a hundred degree heat

Lafayette:
As we snatch a stalemate from the jaws of defeat

Hamilton:
Charles Lee was left behind
Without a pot to piss in
He started sayin' this to anybody who would listen:

Lee:
Washington cannot be left alone to his devices
Indecisive, from crisis to crisis
The best thing he can do for the revolution
Is turn n' go back to plantin' tobacco in Mount Vernon

Company:
Oo!

Washington:
Don't do a thing. History will prove him wrong

Hamilton:
But, sir!

Washington:
We have a war to fight, let's move along

Laurens:
Strong words from Lee, someone oughta hold him to it

Hamilton:
I can't disobey direct orders

Laurens:
Then I'll do it
Alexander, you're the closest friend I've got

Hamilton:
Laurens, do not throw away your shot

Men:
One, two, three, four

Full Company:
Five, six, seven, eight, nine…

Burr/Hamilton/Laurens/Lee:
It's the Ten Duel Commandments

Full Company:
It's the Ten Duel Commandments
Number one!

Laurens:
The challenge: demand satisfaction
If they apologize, no need for further action

Company:
Number two!

Laurens:
If they don't, grab a friend, that's your second

Hamilton:
Your lieutenant when there's reckoning to be reckoned

Company:
Number three!

Lee:
Have your seconds meet face to face

Burr:
Negotiate a peace…

Hamilton:
Or negotiate a time and place

Burr:
This is commonplace, 'specially 'tween recruits

Company:
Most disputes die, and no one shoots
Number four!

Laurens:
If they don't reach a peace, that's alright
Time to get some pistols and a doctor on site

Hamilton:
You pay him in advance, you treat him with civility

Burr:
You have him turn around so he can have deniability

Company:
Five!

Lee:
Duel before the sun is in the sky

Company:
Pick a place to die where it's high and dry
Number six!

Hamilton:
Leave a note for your next of kin
Tell 'em where you been. Pray that hell or heaven lets you in

Company:
Seven!

Lee:
Confess your sins. Ready for the moment
Of adrenaline when you finally face your opponent

Company:
Number eight!

Laurens/Lee/Hamilton/Burr:
Your last chance to negotiate
Send in your seconds, see if they can set the record straight…

Burr:
Alexander

Hamilton:
Aaron Burr, sir

Burr:
Can we agree that duels are dumb and immature?

Hamilton:
Sure
But your man has to answer for his words, Burr

Burr:
With his life? We both know that's absurd, sir

Hamilton:
Hang on, how many men died because Lee was inexperienced and ruinous?

Burr:
Okay, so we're doin' this

Company:
Number nine!

Hamilton:
Look 'em in the eye, aim no higher
Summon all the courage you require
Then count

Men:
One two three four

Full Company:
Five six seven eight nine

Hamilton/Burr:
Number

Company:
Ten paces!

Hamilton/Burr:
Fire!

Hamilton:
Lee, do you yield?

Burr:
You shot him in the side!
Yes, he yields!

Laurens:
I'm satisfied

Burr:
Yo, we gotta clear the field!

Hamilton:
Go! We won

Company:
Here comes the General!

Burr:
This should be fun

Washington:
What is the meaning of this? Mr. Burr, get a medic for the General

Burr:
Yes, sir

Washington:
Lee, you will never agree with me
But believe me, these young men don't speak for me
Thank you for your service

Burr:
Let's ride!

Washington:
Hamilton!

Hamilton:
Sir!

Washington:
Meet me inside

Company:
Meet him inside! Meet him inside!
Meet him inside, meet him, meet him inside!

Washington:
Son

Hamilton:
Don't call me son

Washington:
This war is hard enough
Without infighting

Hamilton:
Lee called you out
We called his bluff

Washington:
You solve nothing, you aggravate our allies to the south

Hamilton:
You're absolutely right, John should have shot him in the mouth
That would've shut him up

Washington:
Son

Hamilton:
I'm notcha son

Washington:
Watch your tone
I am not a maiden in need of defending, I am grown

Hamilton (overlapping):
Charles Lee, Thomas Conway
These men take your name and they rake it through the mud

Washington:
My name's been through a lot, I can take it

Hamilton:
Well, I don't have your name
I don't have your titles
I don't have your land
But, if you

Washington:
No

Hamilton:
If you gave me command of a battalion, a group of men to lead, I could fly above my station after the war

Washington:
Or you could die and we need you alive

Hamilton:
I'm more than willing to die

Washington:
Your wife needs you alive, son, I need you alive

Hamilton:
Call me son one more time

Washington:
Go home, Alexander
That's an order from your commander

Hamilton:
Sir

Washington:
Go home

Eliza:
Look around, look around at how lucky we are
To be alive right now
Look around, look around…

Hamilton:
How long have you known?

Eliza:
A month or so

Hamilton:
Eliza, you should have told me

Eliza:
I wrote to the General a month ago

Hamilton:
No

Eliza:
I begged him to send you home

Hamilton:
You should have told me

Eliza:
I'm not sorry

Eliza (Hamilton):
I knew you'd fight until the war was won (The war's not done)
But you deserve a chance to meet your son
Look around, look around at how lucky we are
To be alive right now

Hamilton:
Will you relish being a poor man's wife
Unable to provide for your life?

Eliza:
I relish being your wife
Look around, look around…
Look at where you are
Look at where you started
The fact that you're alive is a miracle
Just stay alive, that would be enough
And if this child
Shares a fraction of your smile
Or a fragment of your mind, look out world!
That would be enough
I don't pretend to know
The challenges you're facing
The worlds you keep erasing and creating in your mind
But I'm not afraid
I know who I married
So long as you come home at the end of the day
That would be enough
We don't need a legacy
We don't need money
If I could grant you peace of mind
If you could let me inside your heart…
Oh, let me be a part of the narrative
In the story they will write someday
Let this moment be the first chapter:
Where you decide to stay
And I could be enough
And we could be enough
That would be enough

Burr:
How does a ragtag volunteer army in need of a shower
Somehow defeat a global superpower?
How do we emerge victorious from the quagmire?
Leave the battlefield waving Betsy Ross' flag higher?
Yo. Turns out we have a secret weapon!
An immigrant you know and love who's unafraid to step in!
He's constantly confusin', confoundin' the British henchmen
Everyone give it up for America's favourite fighting Frenchman!

Company:
Lafayette!

Lafayette:
I'm taking this horse by the reins makin' redcoats redder with bloodstains

Company:
Lafayette!

Lafayette:
And I'm never gonna stop
Until I make 'em drop
And burn 'em up and scatter their remains,
I'm

Company:
Lafayette!

Lafayette:
Watch me engagin' 'em,
Escapin' 'em!
Enragin' 'em.
I'm out!

Company:
Lafayette!

Lafayette:
I go to France for more funds

Company:
Lafayette!

Lafayette:
I come back with more

Lafayette and Ensemble:
Guns
And ships
And so the balance shifts

Washington:
We rendezvous
With Rochambeau,
Consolidate their gifts

Lafayette:
We can end this war in Yorktown, cut them off at sea,
But for this to succeed,
There is someone else we need:

Washington:
I know

Washington and Company:
Hamilton!

Lafayette:
Sir, he knows what to do in a trench
Ingenuitive and fluent in French, I mean

Washington and Company:
Hamilton!

Lafayette:
Sir, you're gonna have to use him eventually
What's he gonna do on the bench? I mean

Washington and Company:
Hamilton!

Lafayette:
No one has more resilience
Or matches my practical tactical brilliance

Washington and Company:
Hamilton!

Lafayette:
You wanna fight for your land back?

Company:
Hamilton!

Washington:
I need my right-hand man back!

Women:
Hamilton!

Lafayette (men):
Ah! Uh, get ya right-hand man back (Get your right-hand man back!)
You know you gotta get ya right hand man back (Your right-hand man back!)

Lafayette (women/men):
I mean you gotta put some thought into the letter (Hamilton!)
But the sooner the better (Hamilton! Hamilton!)
To get your right hand man back! (Ha ha)

Washington:
Alexander Hamilton
Troops are waiting in the field for you
If you join us right now, together we can turn the tide
Oh, Alexander Hamilton
I have soldiers that will yield for you
If we manage to get this right
They'll surrender by early light
The world will never be the same, Alexander…

Washington:
I was younger than you are now
When I was given my first command
I led my men straight into a massacre
I witnessed their deaths firsthand
I made every mistake
And felt the shame rise in me
And even now I lie awake

Washington (Laurens/Mulligan):
Knowing history has its eyes on me (Whoa oh oh…)
(Whoa…)
(Whoa…)
(Yeah)

Hamilton/Washington (Company):
History has its eyes on me (Whoa oh oh…)
(Whoa…)
(Whoa…)
(Yeah)

Washington:
Let me tell you what I wish I'd known
When I was young and dreamed of glory
You have no control

Washington And Company:
Who lives, who dies, who tells your story

Washington:
I know that we can win
I know that greatness lies in you
But remember from here on in

Washington/Hamilton and men (Ensemble):
History has its eyes on you (Whoa oh oh…)
(Whoa…)
(Whoa…)

Full Company:
History has its eyes on you

Company:
The battle of Yorktown
1781

Lafayette:
Monsieur Hamilton

Hamilton:
Monsieur Lafayette

Lafayette:
In command where you belong

Hamilton:
How you say, no sweat
We're finally on the field
We've had quite a run

Lafayette:
Immigrants:

Hamilton/Lafayette:
We get the job done

Hamilton:
So what happens if we win?

Lafayette:
I go back to France
I bring freedom to my people if I'm given the chance

Hamilton:
We'll be with you when you do

Lafayette:
Go lead your men

Hamilton:
I’ll see you on the other side

Lafayette:
'Til we meet again, let's go!

Ensemble:
I am not throwin' away my shot!
I am not throwin' away my shot!
Hey yo, I'm just like my country, I'm young
Scrappy and hungry
And I'm not throwin' away my shot!
I am not throwin' away my shot!

Hamilton:
'Til the world turns upside down…

Ensemble:
'Til the world turns upside down!

Hamilton:
I imagine death so much it feels more like a memory
This is where it gets me: on my feet
The enemy ahead of me
If this is the end of me, at least I have a friend with me
Weapon in my hand, a command, and my men with me
Then I remember my Eliza's expecting me...
Not only that, my Eliza's expecting
We gotta go, gotta get the job done
Gotta start a new nation, gotta meet my son!
Take the bullets out your gun!

Ensemble:
What?

Hamilton:
The bullets out your gun!

Ensemble:
What?

Hamilton:
We move under cover and we move as one
Through the night, we have one shot to live another day
We cannot let a stray gunshot give us away
We will fight up close, seize the moment and stay in it
It's either that or meet the business end of a bayonet
The code word is 'Rochambeau' dig me?

Ensemble:
Rochambeau!

Hamilton:
You have your orders now, go, man, go!
And so the American experiment begins
With my friends all scattered to the winds
Laurens is in South Carolina, redefining brav'ry

Hamilton/Laurens:
We'll never be free until we end slavery!

Hamilton:
When we finally drive the British away
Lafayette is there waiting

Hamilton/Lafayette:
In Chesapeake Bay!

Hamilton:
How did we know that this plan would work?
We had a spy on the inside
That's right

Hamilton/Company:
Hercules Mulligan!

Mulligan:
A tailor spyin' on the British government!
I take their measurements, information and then I smuggle it

Company:
Up

Mulligan:
To my brother's revolutionary covenant
I'm runnin' with the Sons of Liberty and I am lovin' it!
See, that's what happens when you up against the ruffians
We in the shit now, somebody's gotta shovel it!
Hercules Mulligan, I need no introduction
When you knock me down I get the fuck back up again!

Company:
Let's go! Woo!
Left! Right! Hold!
Go!
What! What! What!

Hamilton:
After a week of fighting, a young man in a red coat stands on a parapet

Lafayette:
We lower our guns as he frantically waves a white handkerchief

Mulligan:
And just like that, it's over. We tend to our wounded, we count our dead

Laurens:
Black and white soldiers wonder alike if this really means freedom

Washington:
Not yet

Hamilton:
We negotiate the terms of surrender
I see George Washington smile
We escort their men out of Yorktown
They stagger home single file
Tens of thousands of people flood the streets
There are screams and church bells ringing
And as our fallen foes retreat
I hear the drinking song they're singing…

All men:
The world turned upside down

Full Company:
The world turned upside down
The world turned upside down
The world turned upside down
Down
Down, down, down

Lafayette:
Freedom for America, freedom for France!

Company:
Down, down, down

Hamilton:
Gotta start a new nation
Gotta meet my son

Company:
Down, down, down

Mulligan:
We won!

Lafayette:
We won!

Mulligan/Lafayette/Laurens:
We won!

Mulligan/Lafayette/Laurens/Hamilton/Washington:
We won!

Company:
The world turned upside down!

King George:
They say
The price of my war's not a price that they're willing to pay
Insane
You cheat with the French, now I'm fighting with France and with Spain
I'm so blue
I thought that we'd made an arrangement
When you went away
You were mine to subdue
Well, even despite our estrangement, I've got
A small query for you:
What comes next?
You've been freed
Do you know how hard it is to lead?
You're on your own
Awesome. Wow
Do you have a clue what happens now?
Oceans rise
Empires fall
It's much harder when it's all your call
All alone, across the sea
When your people say they hate you
Don't come crawling back to me
Da da da da daaaaaaa, da da da da dayyyyyyyy ya da
Da da da-da day ya daa...
You're on your own…

Burr:
Dear Theodosia, what to say to you?
You have my eyes. You have your mother's name
When you came into the world, you cried and it broke my heart
I'm dedicating every day to you
Domestic life was never quite my style
When you smile, you knock me out, I fall apart
And I thought I was so smart
You will come of age with our young nation
We'll bleed and fight for you, we'll make it right for you
If we lay a strong enough foundation
We'll pass it on to you, we'll give the world to you
And you'll blow us all away…
Someday, someday
Yeah, you'll blow us all away
Someday, someday

Hamilton:
Oh Philip, when you smile I am undone
My son
Look at my son
Pride is not the word I'm looking for
There is so much more inside me now
Oh Philip, you outshine the morning sun
My son
When you smile, I fall apart
And I thought I was so smart
My father wasn't around

Burr:
My father wasn't around

Hamilton:
I swear that

Burr/Hamilton:
I'll be around for you

Hamilton:
I'll do whatever it takes

Burr:
I'll make a million mistakes

Burr/Hamilton:
I'll make the world safe and sound for you…
…Will come of age with our young nation
We'll bleed and fight for you, we'll make it right for you
If we lay a strong enough foundation
We'll pass it on to you, we'll give the world to you
And you'll blow us all away...
Someday, someday
Yeah, you'll blow us all away
Someday, someday

Burr:
After the war I went back to New York

Hamilton:
A-after the war I went back to New York

Burr:
I finished up my studies and I practiced law

Hamilton:
I practiced law, Burr worked next door

Burr:
Even though we started at the very same time
Alexander Hamilton began to climb
How to account for his rise to the top?
Maaaaan, the man is

Burr and Ensemble:
Non-stop

Hamilton:
Gentlemen of the jury, I'm curious, bear with me
Are you aware that we're making hist'ry?
This is the first murder trial of our brand-new nation
The liberty behind deliberation

Ensemble:
Non-stop

Hamilton:
I intend to prove beyond a shadow of a doubt
With my assistant counsel

Burr:
Co-counsel
Hamilton, sit down
Our client Levi Weeks is innocent
Call your first witness
That's all you had to say

Hamilton:
Okay
One more thing

Burr:
Why do you assume you're the smartest in the room?
Why do you assume you're the smartest in the room?
Why do you assume you're the smartest in the room?
Soon that attitude may be your doom

Ensemble:
Awwww

Burr (Ensemble):
Why do you write like you're running out of time? (Why do you write like you're running out of time?)
Write day and night like you're running out of time?
Ev'ry day you fight, like you're running out of time (Ev'ry day you fight, like you're running out of time)
Keep on fighting in the meantime
(Non-stop!)

Hamilton:
Corruption's such an old song that we can sing along in harmony
And nowhere is it stronger than in Albany
This colony's economy's increasingly stalling and honestly
That's why public service seems to be calling me (Burr and Ensemble: He's just non-stop!)
I practiced the law, I practic'ly perfected it
I've seen injustice in the world and I've corrected it
Now for a strong central democracy
If not, then I'll be Socrates
Throwing verbal rocks at these mediocrities
Ensemble:
Awww

Burr:
Hamilton, at the Constitutional Convention

Hamilton:
I was chosen for the Constitutional Convention

Burr:
There as a New York junior delegate

Hamilton:
Now what I'm going to say may sound indelicate
Company:
Awwww

Burr (Company):
Goes and proposes his own form of government! (What?)
His own plan for a new form of government! (What?)

Burr:
Talks for six hours! The convention is listless

Ensemble man:
Bright young man

Another Ensemble man:
Yo, who the f is this?

Burr (Company):
Why do you always say what you believe?
Why do you always say what you believe? (Why do you always say what you believe?)
Ev'ry proclamation guarantees
Free ammunition for your enemies
(Awww!)

Burr and men (all women):
Why do you write like it's
Going out of style? (Going out of style, hey!)
Write day and night like it's
Going out of style? (Going out of style, hey!)

Burr and Company:
Ev'ry day you fight like it's
Going out of style
Do what you do

Burr:
Alexander?

Hamilton:
Aaron Burr, sir

Burr:
Well, it's the middle of the night

Hamilton:
Can we confer, sir?

Burr:
Is this a legal matter?

Hamilton:
Yes, and it's important to me

Burr:
What do you need?

Hamilton:
Burr, you're a better lawyer than me

Burr:
Okay

Hamilton:
I know I talk too much, I'm abrasive
You're incredible in court
You're succinct, persuasive
My client needs a strong defense
You're the solution

Burr:
Who's your client?

Hamilton:
The new U.S. Constitution

Burr:
No

Hamilton:
Hear me out

Burr:
No way

Hamilton:
A series of essays, anonymously published
Defending the document to the public

Burr:
No one will read it

Hamilton:
I disagree

Burr:
And if it fails?

Hamilton:
Burr, that's why we need it

Burr:
The constitution's a mess

Hamilton:
So it needs amendments

Burr:
It's full of contradictions

Hamilton:
So is independence
We have to start somewhere

Burr:
No, no way

Hamilton:
You're making a mistake

Burr:
Good night

Hamilton:
Hey
What are you waiting for?
What do you stall for?

Burr:
What?

Hamilton:
We won the war
What was it all for?
Do you support this constitution?

Burr:
Of course

Hamilton:
Then defend it

Burr:
And what if you're backing the wrong horse?

Hamilton:
Burr, we studied and we fought and we killed
For the notion of a nation we now get to build
For once in your life, take a stand with pride
I don't understand how you stand to the side

Burr (Ensemble):
I'll keep all my plans
Close to my chest (Wait for it, wait for it, wait…)
I'll wait here and see

Burr/Ensemble:
Which way the wind will blow
I'm taking my time
Watching the afterbirth of a nation
Watching the tension grow

Angelica:
I am sailing off to London
I'm accompanied by someone who always pays
I have found a wealthy husband
Who will keep me in comfort for all my days
He is not a lot of fun, but there's no one
Who can match you for turn of phrase
My Alexander

Hamilton:
Angelica

Angelica:
Don't forget to write

Eliza:
Look at where you are
Look at where you started
The fact that you're alive is a miracle
Just stay alive, that would be enough
And if your wife could share a fraction of your time
If I could grant you peace of mind
Would that be enough?

Burr:
Alexander joins forces with James Madison and John Jay to write a series of essays defending the new United States Constitution, entitled The Federalist Papers. The plan was to write a total of twenty-five essays, the work divided evenly among the three men. In the end, they wrote eighty-five essays, in the span of six months. John Jay got sick after writing five. James Madison wrote twenty-nine. Hamilton wrote the other fifty-one

Burr (all women):
How do you write like you're
Running out of time? (Running out of time?)
Write day and night like you're
Running out of time? (Running out of time?)
Burr and men (all women):
Ev'ry day you fight like you're
Running out of time (Running out of time)
Like you're
Running out of time (Running out of time)
Are you running out of time? (Awwww!)

Full Company except Hamilton:
How do you write like tomorrow won't arrive?
How do you write like you need it to survive?
How do you write ev'ry second you're alive?
Ev'ry second you're alive?
Ev'ry second you're alive?

Washington:
They are asking me to lead
I am doing the best I can
To get the people that I need
I'm asking you to be my right hand man

Hamilton:
Treasury or State?

Washington:
I know it's a lot to ask

Hamilton:
Treasury or State?

Washington:
To leave behind the world you know

Hamilton:
Sir, do you want me to run the Treasury or State department?

Washington:
Treasury

Hamilton:
Let's go

Eliza:
Alexander

Hamilton:
I have to leave

Eliza:
Alexander

Hamilton:
Look around, look around at how lucky we are to be alive right now

Eliza:
Helpless

Hamilton:
They are asking me to lead

Eliza:
Look around, isn't this enough?

Angelica (Eliza):
He will never be satisfied
(What would be enough)
He will never be satisfied (To be satisfied)
Satisfied (Satisfied)
Satisfied (Satisfied)

Washington:
History has its eyes on you

Burr: Why do you assume you're the smartest in the room?
Why do you assume you're the smartest in the room?
Soon that attitude's gonna be your doom

Eliza: Look around! Look around! Isn't this enough? What would be enough?

Washington/Mulligan/Laurence/Lafayette: History has its eyes on you

Angelica: He will never be satisfied, satisfied, satisfied
All: Non-Stop! Non-Stop! Non-Stop! Non-Stop
Why do you fight like

Company:
History has its eyes on you

Hamilton (men) {Full Company}:
I am not throwin' away my shot! (Just you wait!)
I am not throwin' away my shot! {Just you wait!}
I am
Alexander Hamilton! {Alexander Hamilton}
{Hamilton, just you wait!}
I am not throwin' away my shot

Company:
Seventeen. Se-se-seventeen...
Se-se-seventeen…

Burr:
1789
How does the bastard orphan
Immigrant decorated war vet
Unite the colonies through more debt?
Fight the other founding fathers 'til he has to forfeit?
Have it all, lose it all
You ready for more yet?
Treasury Secretary. Washington's the President
Every American experiment sets a precedent
Not so fast. Someone came along to resist him
Pissed him off until we had a two-party system
You haven't met him yet, you haven't had the chance
'Cause he's been kickin' ass as the ambassador to France
But someone's gotta keep the American promise
You simply must meet Thomas. Thomas!

Company:
Thomas Jefferson's coming home!
Thomas Jefferson's coming home!
Thomas Jefferson's coming home!
Thomas Jefferson's coming home!
Thomas Jefferson's coming home
Lord he's been off in Paris for so long!
Ah-ooh!
Ah-ooh!

Jefferson:
France is following us to revolution
There is no more status quo
But the sun comes up
And the world still spins

Ensemble:
Ah-ooh!

Jefferson:
I helped Lafayette draft a declaration
Then I said, "I gotta go
I gotta be in Monticello."
Now the work at home begins…

Ensemble:
Ah-ooh!

Jefferson:
So what did I miss?
What did I miss?
Hmm
Virginia, my home sweet home, I wanna give you a kiss
Muah
I've been in Paris meeting lots of different ladies...
I guess I basically missed the late eighties...
I traveled the wide, wide world and came back to this…

Ensemble:
Ah-ooh!

Jefferson:
There's a letter on my desk from the President
Haven't even put my bag down yet
Sally be a lamb, darlin', won't you open it?
It says the President's assembling a cabinet
And that I am to be the Secretary of State, great!
And that I'm already Senate-approved...
I just got home and now I'm headed up to New York

Ensemble:
Headin' to New York!
Headin' to New York!

Jefferson (Ensemble):
Lookin' at the rolling fields
I can't believe that we are free (Believe that we are free)
Ready to face whatever's awaiting
Me in N.Y.C. (Me in N.Y.C.)
But who's waitin' for me when I step in the place?
My friend James Madison, red in the face
He grabs my arm and I respond,
"What's goin' on?" (Ah-ooh!)

Madison:
Thomas, we are engaged in a battle for our nation's very soul
Can you get us out of the mess we're in?

Ensemble:
Ah-ooh!

Madison:
Hamilton's new financial plan is nothing less
Than government control
I've been fighting for the South alone
Where have you been?

Jefferson:
Uh... France

Ensemble:
Ah-ooh!

Madison:
We have to win

Jefferson (Ensemble):
Well, what'd I miss?
(What? What? What'd I miss?)
What'd I miss?
(I've come home to this?)
Headfirst into a political abyss!
(Headfirst, into the abyss!)
I have my first cabinet meeting today
(Chik-a-pow!)
I guess I better think of something to say
I'm already on my way (On my way)
To get to the bottom of this…
(What did I miss? Ah ah!)

Washington:
Mr. Jefferson, welcome home

Hamilton:
Mr. Jefferson? Alexander Hamilton

Washington and Ensemble:
Mr. Jefferson, welcome home

Company:
Mr. Jefferson, welcome home
Sir, you've been off in Paris for so long!

Jefferson:
So what did I miss?

Washington:
Ladies and gentlemen, you coulda been anywhere in the world tonight, but you're here with us in New York City. Are you ready for a cabinet meeting?

The issue on the table: Secretary Hamilton's plan to assume state debt and establish a national bank. Secretary Jefferson, you have the floor, sir

Jefferson:
"Life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness"
We fought for these ideals; we shouldn't settle for less
These are wise words, enterprising men quote 'em
Don't act surprised, you guys, 'cause I wrote 'em

Jefferson/Madison:
Oww

Jefferson:
But Hamilton forgets
His plan would have the government assume state's debts
Now, place your bets as to who that benefits:
The very seat of government where Hamilton sits

Hamilton:
Not true!

Jefferson:
Ooh, if the shoe fits, wear it
If New York's in debt—
Why should Virginia bear it? Uh! Our debts are paid, I'm afraid
Don't tax the South 'cause we got it made in the shade
In Virginia, we plant seeds in the ground
We create. You just wanna move our money around
This financial plan is an outrageous demand
And it's too many damn pages for any man to understand
Stand with me in the land of the free
And pray to God we never see Hamilton's candidacy
Look, when Britain taxed our tea, we got frisky
Imagine what gon' happen when you try to tax our whisky

Washington:
Thank you, Secretary Jefferson
(Crowd (reacting): That's my alcohol!)
Secretary Hamilton, your response

Hamilton:
Thomas. That was a real nice declaration
Welcome to the present, we're running a real nation
Would you like to join us, or stay mellow
Doin' whatever the hell it is you do in Monticello?
If we assume the debts, the union gets
A new line of credit, a financial diuretic
How do you not get it? If we're aggressive and competitive
The union gets a boost. You'd rather give it a sedative?
A civics lesson from a slaver. Hey, neighbor
Your debts are paid 'cause you don't pay for labor
"We plant seeds in the South. We create"
Yeah, keep ranting
We know who's really doing the planting
And another thing, Mr. Age of Enlightenment
Don't lecture me about the war, you didn't fight in it
You think I'm frightened of you, man?
We almost died in the trench
While you were off getting high with the French
Thomas Jefferson, always hesitant with the President
Reticent—there isn't a plan he doesn't jettison
Madison, you're mad as a hatter, son, take your medicine
Damn, you're in worse shape than the national debt is in
Sittin' there useless as two shits
Hey, turn around, bend over, I'll show you
Where my shoe fits

Washington:
Excuse me? Madison, Jefferson, take a walk! Hamilton, take a walk! We'll reconvene after a brief recess. Hamilton!

Hamilton:
Sir!

Washington:
A word

Madison:
You don't have the votes

Jefferson/Madison:
You don't have the votes

Jefferson:
Aha-ha-ha ha ha!

Jefferson/Madison:
You're gonna need congressional approval and you don't have the votes

Jefferson:
Such a blunder sometimes it makes me wonder why I even bring the thunder

Madison:
Why he even brings the thunder…

Washington:
You wanna pull yourself together?

Hamilton:
I'm sorry, these Virginians are birds of a feather

Washington:
Young man, I'm from Virginia, so watch your mouth

Hamilton:
So we let Congress get held hostage by the South?

Washington:
You need the votes

Hamilton:
No, we need bold strokes
We need this plan

Washington:
No, you need to convince more folks

Hamilton:
James Madison won't talk to me, that's a nonstarter

Washington:
Winning was easy, young man
Governing's harder

Hamilton:
They're being intransigent

Washington:
You have to find a compromise

Hamilton:
But they don't have a plan, they just hate mine!

Washington:
Convince them otherwise

Hamilton:
And what happens if I don't get congressional approval?

Washington:
I imagine they'll call for your removal

Hamilton:
Sir

Washington:
Figure it out, Alexander
That's an order from your commander

Eliza (Philip):
Un deux trois quatre
Cinq six sept huit neuf (Un deux trois quatre)
(Cinq six sept huit neuf)
Good! Un deux trois quatre
Cinq six sept huit neuf (Un deux trois quatre)
(Cinq six sept huit neuf)
Sept huit neuf
(Sept huit neuf)
Sept huit neuf
(Sept huit neuf)

Eliza and Philip:
One two three four five six seven eight nine!

Hamilton:
My dearest, Angelica
"Tomorrow and tomorrow and tomorrow
Creeps in this petty pace from day to day"
I trust you'll understand the reference to
Another Scottish tragedy without my having to name the play
They think me Macbeth, and ambition is my folly
I'm a polymath, a pain in the ass, a massive pain
Madison is Banquo, Jefferson's Macduff
And Birnam Wood is Congress on its way to Dunsinane

Hamilton/Angelica:
And there you are, an ocean away
Do you have to live an ocean away?
Thoughts of you subside
Then I get another letter
And I cannot put the notion away…

Eliza:
Take a break

Hamilton:
I am on my way

Eliza:
There's a little surprise before supper
And it cannot wait

Hamilton:
I'll be there in just a minute, save my plate

Eliza:
Alexander

Hamilton:
Okay, okay

Eliza:
Your son is nine years old today
He has something he'd like to say
He's been practicing all day
Philip, take it away

Philip (Hamilton):
Daddy, daddy, look
My name is Philip
I am a poet
I wrote this poem just to show it
And I just turned nine
You can write rhymes
But you can't write mine
(What!)
I practice French
And play piano with my mother
(Uh-huh!)
I have a sister, but I want a little brother
(Okay!)
My daddy's trying to start America's bank
Un deux trois quatre cinq!
(Bravo!)

Eliza:
Take a break

Hamilton:
Hey, our kid is pretty great

Eliza:
Run away with us for the summer
Let's go upstate

Hamilton:
Eliza, I've got so much on my plate

Eliza:
We can all go stay with my father
There's a lake I know…

Hamilton:
I know

Eliza:
In a nearby park

Hamilton:
I'd love to go

Eliza:
You and I can go when the night gets dark…

Hamilton:
I will try to get away

Angelica:
My dearest Alexander
You must get through to Jefferson
Sit down with him and compromise
Don't stop 'til you agree
Your fav'rite older sister
Angelica, reminds you
There's someone in your corner all the way across the sea
In a letter I received from you two weeks ago
I noticed a comma in the middle of a phrase
It changed the meaning. Did you intend this?
One stroke and you've consumed my waking days
It says:

Hamilton/Angelica:
"My dearest Angelica"

Angelica:
With a comma after "dearest"
You've written

Hamilton and Angelica:
"My dearest, Angelica."

Angelica:
Anyway, all this to say
I'm coming home this summer
At my sister's invitation
I'll be there with your fam'ly
If you make your way upstate
I know you're very busy
I know your work's important
But I'm crossing the ocean and I just can't wait

Hamilton and Angelica:
You won't be an ocean away
You will only be a moment away…

Eliza:
Alexander, come downstairs
Angelica's arriving today!

Eliza:
Angelica!

Angelica:
Eliza!

Hamilton:
The Schuyler sisters!

Angelica:
Alexander

Hamilton:
Hi

Angelica:
It's good to see your face

Eliza:
Angelica, tell this man John Adams spends the summer with his family

Hamilton:
Angelica, tell my wife John Adams doesn't have a real job anyway

Angelica:
…you're not joining us? Wait

Hamilton:
I'm afraid I cannot join you upstate

Angelica:
Alexander, I came all this way

Eliza:
She came all this way

Angelica:
All this way

Eliza and Angelica:
Take a break

Hamilton:
You know I have to get my plan through Congress

Eliza and Angelica:
Run away with us for the summer
Let's go upstate

Hamilton:
I lose my job if we don't get this plan through Congress

Eliza and Angelica:
We can all go stay with our father

Eliza (Angelica):
There's a lake I know
(I know I'll miss your face)
In a nearby park
(Screw your courage to the sticking place)
You and I can go
(Eliza's right)
Take a break and get away (Take a break)
(Run away with us for the summer)
Let's go upstate (Let's go upstate)
Where we can stay
(We can all go stay with our father)
(If you take your time)
Look around, look around
(You will make your mark)
At how lucky we are to be alive right now
(Close your eyes and dream)
We can go
When the night gets dark (When the night gets dark)
Take a break (Take a break)

Hamilton:
I have to get my plan through Congress
I can't stop until I get this plan through Congress

Burr:
There's nothing like summer in the city
Someone under stress meets someone looking pretty
There's trouble in the air, you can smell it
And Alexander's by himself. I'll let him tell it

Hamilton:
I hadn't slept in a week
I was weak, I was awake
You never seen a bastard orphan
More in need of a break
Longing for Angelica
Missing my wife
That's when Miss Maria Reynolds walked into my life, she said:

Maria:
I know you are a man of honor
I'm so sorry to bother you at home
But I don't know where to go, and I came here all alone…

Hamilton:
She said:

Maria:
My husband's doin' me wrong
Beatin' me, cheatin' me, mistreatin' me...
Suddenly he's up and gone
I don't have the means to go on

Hamilton:
So I offered her a loan, I offered to walk her home, she said

Maria:
You're too kind, sir

Hamilton:
I gave her thirty bucks that I had socked away
She lived a block away, she said:

Maria:
This one's mine, sir

Hamilton:
Then I said, "Well, I should head back home,"
She turned red, she led me to her bed
Let her legs spread and said:

Maria:
Stay?

Hamilton:
Hey…

Maria:
Hey…

Hamilton:
That's when I began to pray:
Lord, show me how to
Say no to this
I don't know how to
Say no to this
But my God, she looks so helpless
And her body's saying, "Hell, yes."

Maria:
Whoa...

Hamilton:
No, show me how to

Hamilton/Ensemble:
Say no to this

Hamilton:
I don't know how to

Hamilton/Ensemble:
Say no to this

Hamilton:
In my mind, I'm tryin' to go

Ensemble:
Go! Go! Go!

Hamilton:
Then her mouth is on mine, and I don't say…

Ensemble:
No! No!
Say no to this!
No! No!
Say no to this!
No! No!
Say no to this!
No! No!
Say no to this!

Hamilton:
I wish I could say that was the last time
I said that last time. It became a pastime
A month into this endeavor I received a letter
From a Mr. James Reynolds, even better, it said:

James:
Dear Sir, I hope this letter finds you in good health
And in a prosperous enough position to put wealth
In the pockets of people like me: down on their luck
You see, that was my wife who you decided to

Hamilton:
Fuuuu...

James:
Uh-oh! You made the wrong sucker a cuckold
So time to pay the piper for the pants you unbuckled
And hey, you can keep seein' my whore wife
If the price is right: if not I'm telling your wife

Hamilton:
I hid the letter and I raced to her place
Screamed, "How could you?!" in her face
She said:

Maria:
No, sir!

Hamilton:
Half dressed, apologetic
A mess, she looked pathetic, she cried:

Maria:
Please don't go, sir!

Hamilton:
So was your whole story a setup?

Maria:
I don't know about any letter!

Hamilton:
Stop crying
Goddammit, get up!

Maria:
I didn't know any better

Hamilton:
I am ruined...


Maria (Hamilton):
Please don't leave me with him helpless (I am helpless — how could I do this?)
Just give him what he wants and you can have me
(I don't want you)
Whatever you want (I don't want you)
If you pay (I don't)
You can stay

Maria (Hamilton) {Ensemble}:
(Lord, show me how to say no to this) {Say no to this}
Tonight (I don't know how to say no to this) {Say no to this}
('Cause the situation's helpless)
Helpless
(And her body's screaming, "Hell, yes.")
Whoa!
(No, show me how to say no to this) {Say no to this}
How can you say no to this? (How can I say no to this?) {Say no to this}
(There is nowhere I can go)
{Go! Go! Go!}
(When her body's on mine I do not say...) {No!}
(Yes) Yes {Say no to this! No!}
(Yes) Yes {Say no to this! No!}
(Yes) Ye-ye-yes {Say no to this! No!}
(Yes) Yes {Say no to this!}
(Say no to this...)
(I don't say no to this) Don't say no to this
(There is nowhere I can go)
{Go! Go! Go!}

James:
So?

Hamilton:
Nobody needs to know

Burr:
Ah, Mister Secretary

Hamilton:
Mister Burr, sir

Burr:
Didja hear the news about good old General Mercer?

Hamilton:
No

Burr:
You know Clermont Street?

Hamilton:
Yeah

Burr:
They renamed it after him
The Mercer legacy is secure

Hamilton:
Sure

Burr:
And all he had to do was die

Hamilton:
That's a lot less work

Burr:
We oughta give it a try

Hamilton:
Ha

Burr:
Now how're you gonna get your debt plan through?

Hamilton:
I guess I'm gonna fin'ly have to listen to you

Burr:
Really?

Hamilton:
"Talk less. Smile more."

Burr:
Ha ha

Hamilton:
Do whatever it takes to get my plan on the Congress floor

Burr:
Now, Madison and Jefferson are merciless

Hamilton:
Well, hate the sin, love the sinner

Madison:
Hamilton!

Hamilton:
I'm sorry Burr, I've gotta go

Burr:
But...

Hamilton:
Decisions are happening over dinner

Burr:
Two Virginians and an immigrant walk into a room

Burr and Ensemble:
Diametric'ly opposed, foes

Burr:
They emerge with a compromise, having opened doors that were

Burr and Ensemble:
Previously closed

Ensemble:
Bros

Burr:
The immigrant emerges with unprecedented financial power
A system he can shape however he wants
The Virginians emerge with the nation's capital
And here's the pièce de résistance:

Burr (Ensemble):
No one else was in
The room where it happened
The room where it happened
The room where it happened
No one else was in
The room where it happened (The room where it happened)
The room where it happened
The room where it happened (The room where it happened)
No one really knows how the game is played (Game is played)
The art of the trade
How the sausage gets made (How the sausage gets made)
We just assume that it happens (Assume that it happens)
But no one else is in
The room where it happens (The room where it happens)

Burr and Company:
Thomas claims

Jefferson:
Alexander was on Washington's doorstep one day
In distress 'n disarray

Burr and Company:
Thomas claims

Jefferson:
Alexander said

Hamilton:
I've nowhere else to turn!

Jefferson:
And basic'ly begged me to join the fray

Burr and Company:
Thomas claims

Jefferson:
I approached Madison and said,
"I know you hate 'im, but let's hear what he has to say."

Burr and Company:
Thomas claims

Jefferson:
Well, I arranged the meeting
I arranged the menu, the venue, the seating

Burr:
But!
No one else was in

Burr and Company:
The room where it happened
The room where it happened
The room where it happened

Burr:
No one else was in

Burr and Company:
The room where it happened
The room where it happened
The room where it happened

Burr (Company):
No one really knows how the
Parties get to yes (Parties get to yes)
The pieces that are sacrificed in
Ev'ry game of chess (Ev'ry game of chess)
We just assume that it happens (Assume that it happens)
But no one else is in
The room where it happens (The room where it happens)

Burr and Company:
Meanwhile

Burr:
Madison is grappling with the fact that not ev'ry issue can be settled by committee

Company:
Meanwhile

Burr:
Congress is fighting over where to put the capital

*Company screams in chaos*

Burr:
It isn't pretty
Then Jefferson approaches with a dinner and invite
And Madison responds with Virginian insight:

Madison:
Maybe we can solve one problem with another and win a victory for the Southerners, in other words

Jefferson:
Oh-ho!

Madison:
A quid pro quo

Jefferson:
I suppose

Madison:
Wouldn't you like to work a little closer to home?

Jefferson:
Actually, I would

Madison:
Well, I propose the Potomac

Jefferson:
And you'll provide him his votes?

Madison:
Well, we'll see how it goes

Jefferson:
Let's go

Burr:
No!

Company:
...one else was in
The room where it happened

Burr and Company:
The room where it happened
The room where it happened
No one else was in
The room where it happened
The room where it happened
The room where it happened

Burr:
My God!

Burr and Company:
In God we trust
But we'll never really know what got discussed
Click-boom then it happened

Burr:
And no one else was in the room where it happened

Company:
Alexander Hamilton!

Burr:
What did they say to you to get you to sell New York City down the river?

Company:
Alexander Hamilton!

Burr:
Did Washington know about the dinner?
Was there Presidential pressure to deliver?

Company:
Alexander Hamilton!

Burr:
Or did you know, even then, it doesn't matter
Where you put the U.S. Capital?

Hamilton:
'Cause we'll have the banks
We're in the same spot

Burr:
You got more than you gave

Hamilton:
And I wanted what I got
When you got skin in the game, you stay in the game
But you don't get a win unless you play in the game
Oh, you get love for it
You get hate for it
You get nothing if you…

Hamilton and Company:
Wait for it, wait for it, wait!

Hamilton:
God help and forgive me
I wanna build something that's gonna outlive me

Hamilton/Jefferson/Madison/Washington (Company):
What do you want, Burr? (What do you want, Burr?)
What do you want, Burr? (What do you want, Burr?)
If you stand for nothing (What do you want, Burr?)
Burr, then what do you fall for? (What do you want?)

Burr:
I
I wanna be in the room where it happens
The room where it happens
I
Wanna be in the room where it happens
The room where it happens

Burr (Company):
I (I wanna be in the room where it happens)
Wanna be (The room where it happens)
In the room where it happens (The room where it happens)
I (I wanna be in the room where it happens)
I wanna be in the room… (The room where it happens)
Oh (The room where it happens)
Oh (I wanna be in the room where it happens)
I wanna be (Where it happens)
I wanna be (Where it happens)
I've got to be, I've got to be (I wanna be in the room where it happens)
In that room (The room where it happens)
In that big ol' room (The room where it happens)

Company:
The art of the compromise

Burr:
Hold your nose and close your eyes

Company:
We want our leaders to save the day

Burr:
But we don't get a say in what they trade away

Company:
We dream of a brand new start

Burr:
But we dream in the dark for the most part

Burr and Company:
Dark as a tomb where it happens

Burr (Company):
I've got to be in the room... (The room where it happens)
I've got to be...
(The room where it happens)
I've got to be...
(The room where it happens)
Oh, I've got to be in
The room where it happens... (The room where it happens)
I've got to be, I've gotta be (The room where it happens)
I've gotta be
In the room (I wanna be in the room where it happens)
Click-boom! (Click-boom!)
 
Philip:
Look!
Grandpa's in the paper!
"War hero Philip Schuyler loses senate seat to young upstart Aaron Burr"
Grandpa just lost his seat in the senate

Eliza:
Sometimes that's how it goes

Philip:
Daddy's gonna find out any minute

Eliza:
I'm sure he already knows

Philip:
Further down

Philip and Eliza:
Further down

Philip:
Let's meet the newest senator from New York

Eliza:
New York

Philip and Eliza:
Our senator

Hamilton:
Burr?
Since when are you a Democratic-Republican?

Burr:
Since being one put me on the up and up again

Hamilton:
No one knows who you are or what you do

Burr:
They don't need to know me
They don't like you

Hamilton:
Excuse me?

Burr:
Oh, Wall Street thinks you're great
You'll always be adored by the things you create
But upstate

Hamilton:
Wait

Burr:
People think you're crooked
Schuyler's seat was up for grabs so I took it

Hamilton:
I've always considered you a friend

Burr:
I don't see why that has to end

Hamilton:
You changed parties to run against my father-in-law

Burr:
I changed parties to seize the opportunity I saw
I swear your pride will be the death of us all
Beware, it goeth before the fall

Washington:
The issue on the table: France is on the verge of war with England
And do we provide aid and our troops to our French allies or do we stay out of it?
Remember, my decision on this matter is not subject to congressional approval
The only person you have to convince is me
Secretary Jefferson, you have the floor, sir

Jefferson:
When we were on death's door, when we were needy
We made a promise, we signed a treaty
We needed money and guns and half a chance
Who provided those funds?

Madison:
France

Jefferson:
In return, they didn't ask for land
Only a promise that we'd lend a hand
And stand with them if they fought against oppressors
And revolution is messy but now is the time to stand
Stand with our brothers as they fight against tyranny
I know that Alexander Hamilton is here and he
Would rather not have this debate
I'll remind you that he is not Secretary of State
He knows nothing of loyalty
Smells like new money, dresses like fake royalty
Desperate to rise above his station
Everything he does betrays the ideals of our nation

Ensemble:
Ooh!

Jefferson:
Hey, and if ya don't know, now ya know, Mr. President

Washington:
Thank you, Secretary Jefferson. Secretary Hamilton, your response

Hamilton:
You must be out of your Goddamn mind if you think
The President is gonna bring the nation to the brink
Of meddling in the middle of a military mess
A game of chess, where France is Queen and Kingless
We signed a treaty with a King whose head is now in a basket
Would you like to take it out and ask it?
"Should we honor our treaty, King Louis' head?"
"Uh… do whatever you want, I'm super dead."

Washington:
Enough! Enough. Hamilton is right

Jefferson:
Mr. President—

Washington:
We're too fragile to start another fight

Jefferson:
But sir, do we not fight for freedom?

Washington:
Sure, when the French figure out who's gonna lead 'em

Jefferson:
The people are leading

Washington:
The people are rioting
There's a difference. Frankly, it's a little disquieting you would let your ideals blind you to reality
Hamilton

Hamilton:
Sir

Washington:
Draft a statement of neutrality

Jefferson:
Did you forget Lafayette?

Hamilton:
What?

Jefferson:
Have you an ounce of regret?
You accumulate debt, you accumulate power
Yet in their hour of need, you forget

Hamilton:
Lafayette's a smart man, he'll be fine
And before he was your friend, he was mine
If we try to fight in every revolution in the world, we never stop
Where do we draw the line?

Jefferson:
So quick-witted

Hamilton:
Alas, I admit it

Jefferson:
I bet you were quite a lawyer

Hamilton:
My defendants got acquitted

Jefferson:
Yeah. Well, someone oughta remind you

Hamilton:
What?

Jefferson:
You're nothing without Washington behind you

Washington:
Hamilton!

Jefferson:
Daddy's calling!
Burr:
It must be nice, it must be nice
To have Washington on your side
It must be nice, it must be nice
To have Washington on your side

Jefferson:
Ev'ry action has its equal, opposite reactions
Thanks to Hamilton, our cab'net's fractured into factions
Try not to crack under the stress, we're breaking down like fractions
We smack each other in the press, and we don't print retractions
I get no satisfaction witnessing his fits of passion
The way he primps and preens and dresses like the pits of fashion
Our poorest citizens, our farmers, live ration to ration
As Wall Street robs 'em blind in search of chips to cash in
This prick is askin' for someone to bring him to task
Somebody gimme some dirt on this vacuous mass so we can at last unmask him
I'll pull the trigger on him, someone load the gun and cock it
While we were all watching, he got Washington in his pocket

Jefferson and Burr:
It must be nice, it must be nice
To have Washington on your side
It must be nice, it must be nice
To have Washington on your side 
Look back at the Bill of Rights

Madison:
Which I wrote

Jefferson/Madison/Burr:
The ink hasn't dried
It must be nice, it must be nice
To have Washington on your side

Madison:
So he's doubled the size of the government
Wasn't the trouble with much of our previous government size?

Burr:
Look in his eyes!

Jefferson:
See how he lies

Madison:
Follow the scent of his enterprise

Jefferson:
Centralizing national credit
And making American credit competitive

Madison:
If we don't stop it we aid and abet it

Jefferson:
I have to resign

Madison:
Somebody has to stand up for the South!

Burr:
Somebody has to stand up to his mouth!

Jefferson:
If there's a fire you're trying to douse

Madison and Jefferson:
You can't put it out from inside the house

Jefferson:
I'm in the cabinet, I am complicit in
Watching him grabbin' at power and kissin' it
If Washington isn't gon' listen
To disciplined dissidents, this is the difference:
This kid is out!

Madison/Burr/Jefferson:
Oh!
This immigrant isn't somebody we chose
Oh!
This immigrant's keeping us all on our toes
Oh!
Let's show these Federalists who they're up against!
Oh!

Jefferson/Madison:
Southern motherfuckin'

Jefferson/Madison/Burr:
Democratic-Republicans!

Jefferson/Madison/Burr/Ensemble:
Oh!

Jefferson/Madison/Burr:
Let's follow the money and see where it goes

Ensemble:
Oh!

Jefferson/Madison/Burr:
Because every second the Treasury grows

Ensemble:
Oh!

Jefferson/Madison/Burr:
If we follow the money and see where it leads
Get in the weeds, look for the seeds of Hamilton's misdeeds

Jefferson/Madison/Burr:
It must be nice, it must be nice

Madison:
Follow the money and see where it goes

Jefferson/Madison/Burr:
It must be nice, it must be nice

Jefferson:
The emperor has no clothes

Jefferson/Madison/Burr:
We won't be invisible
We won't be denied
Still
It must be nice, it must be nice
To have Washington on your side

Hamilton:
Mr. President, you asked to see me?

Washington:
I know you're busy

Hamilton:
What do you need, sir? Sir?

Washington:
I wanna give you a word of warning

Hamilton:
Sir, I don't know what you heard
But whatever it is, Jefferson started it

Washington:
Thomas Jefferson resigned this morning

Hamilton:
You're kidding

Washington:
I need a favor

Hamilton:
Whatever you say, sir, Jefferson will pay for this behavior

Washington:
Shh
Talk less

Hamilton:
I'll use the press
I'll write under a pseudonym, you'll see what I can do to him

Washington:
I need you to draft an address

Hamilton:
Yes! He resigned
You can finally speak your mind

Washington:
No, he's stepping down so he can run for President

Hamilton:
Ha. Good luck defeating you, sir

Washington:
I'm stepping down, I'm not running for President

Hamilton:
I'm sorry, what?

Washington:
One last time
Relax, have a drink with me
One last time
Let's take a break tonight
And then we'll teach them how to say goodbye
To say goodbye
You and I

Hamilton:
No, sir, why?

Washington:
I wanna talk about neutrality

Hamilton:
Sir, with Britain and France on the verge of war, is this the best time

Washington:
I want to warn against partisan fighting

Hamilton:
But

Washington:
Pick up a pen, start writing
I wanna talk about what I have learned
The hard-won wisdom I have earned

Hamilton:
As far as the people are concerned
You have to serve, you could continue to serve

Washington:
No! One last time
The people will hear from me
One last time
And if we get this right
We're gonna teach 'em how to say goodbye
You and I

Hamilton:
Mr. President, they will say you're weak

Washington:
No, they will see we're strong

Hamilton:
Your position is so unique

Washington:
So I'll use it to move them along

Hamilton:
Why do you have to say goodbye?

Washington:
If I say goodbye, the nation learns to move on
It outlives me when I'm gone
Like the scripture says:
"Everyone shall sit under their own vine and fig tree
And no one shall make them afraid."
They'll be safe in the nation we've made
I wanna sit under my own vine and fig tree
A moment alone in the shade
At home in this nation we've made
One last time

Hamilton:
One last time

Hamilton:
Though, in reviewing the incidents of my administration, I am unconscious of intentional error, I am nevertheless too sensible of my defects not to think it probable that I may have committed many errors. I shall also carry with me

Hamilton And Washington (Hamilton):
The hope (that my country will) view them with indulgence (and that)
After forty-five years of my life dedicated to its service with an upright zeal
(The faults of incompetent abilities will be) consigned to oblivion,
As I myself must soon be to the mansions of rest
I anticipate with pleasing expectation that retreat in which I promise myself to realize the sweet enjoyment of partaking,
In the midst of my fellow-citizens, the benign influence of good laws under a free government,
The ever-favorite object of my heart, and the happy reward, as I trust
Of our mutual cares, labors, and dangers

Washington:
One last time

All Women:
George Washington's going home!

Hamilton:
Teach 'em how to say goodbye

Company:
George Washington's going home!

Washington:
You and I

Company:
George Washington's going home!

Washington:
Going home

Company:
George Washington's going home!

Washington:
History has its eyes on you, you, you! Yeah!

Company:
George Washington's going home!

Washington (Company):
We're gonna teach 'em how to say goodbye!
(Teach 'em how to say goodbye!)
Teach 'em how to say goodbye!
(Teach 'em how!)
To say goodbye!
(Say goodbye!)
Say goodbye!
(Say goodbye!)
One last time!
(One last time!)

King George:
They say
George Washington's yielding his power and stepping away
Is that true?
I wasn't aware that was something a person could do
I'm perplexed
Are they gonna keep on replacing whoever's in charge?
If so, who's next?
There's nobody else in their country who looms quite as large…
John Adams?!
I know him
That can't be
That's that little guy who spoke to me
All those years ago
What was it, eighty-five?
That poor man, they're gonna eat him alive!
Oceans rise
Empires fall
Next to Washington, they all look small
All alone
Watch them run
They will tear each other into pieces
Jesus Christ, this will be fun!
Da da da dat da dat da da da da ya da
Da da da dat dat da ya daaaaa!
Hahahahahahahahaha
"President John Adams"
Good luck

Burr:
How does Hamilton the short-tempered
Protean creator of the Coast Guard
Founder of the New York Post
Ardently abuse his cab'net post
Destroy his reputation?
Welcome, folks, to

Burr/Company:
The Adams administration!

Burr:
Jefferson's the runner-up, which makes him the Vice President

Jefferson:
Washington can't help you now, no more mister nice President

Burr:
Adams fires Hamilton
Privately calls him "creole bastard" in his taunts

Jefferson:
Say what?!

Burr:
Hamilton publishes his response

Hamilton:
Sit down, John, you fat mother*bleep*

Burr:
Hamilton is out of control

Madison:
This is great!
He's out of power
He holds no office
And he just destroyed President John Adams, the only other significant member of his party

Jefferson:
Hamilton's a host unto himself
As long as he can hold a pen, he's a threat
Let's let him know what we know

Hamilton:
Mr. Vice President
Mr. Madison
Senator Burr
What is this?

Jefferson:
We have the check stubs
From separate accounts…

Madison:
Almost a thousand dollars, paid in different amounts…

Burr:
To a Mr. James Reynolds way back in seventeen ninety-one

Hamilton:
Is that what you have? Are you done?

Madison:
You are uniquely situated by virtue of your position

Jefferson:
Though 'virtue' is not a word I'd apply to this situation

Madison:
To seek financial gain, to stray from your sacred mission

Jefferson:
And the evidence suggests you've engaged in speculation

Burr:
An immigrant embezzling our government funds

Jefferson/Madison:
I can almost see the headline, your career is done

Burr:
I hope you saved some money for your daughter and sons

Burr/Jefferson/Madison:
Ya best g'wan run back where ya come from!

Hamilton:
Ha! You don't even know what you're asking me to confess

Jefferson/Madison/Burr:
Confess

Hamilton:
You have nothing. I don't have to tell you anything at all
Unless

Jefferson/Madison/Burr:
Unless

Hamilton:
If I can prove that I never broke the law
Do you promise not to tell another soul what you saw?

Burr:
No one else was in the room where it happened

Hamilton:
Is that a yes?

Jefferson/Madison/Burr:
Um, yes

Burr:
"Dear Sir, I hope this letter finds you in good health
And in a prosperous enough position to put wealth
In the pockets of people like me: down on their luck
You see, it was my wife who you decided to..."

Jefferson:
Whaaaat

Hamilton:
She courted me
Escorted me to bed and when she had me in a corner
That's when Reynolds extorted me
For a sordid fee
I paid him quarterly
I may have mortally wounded my prospects
But my papers are orderly!
As you can see I kept a record of every check in my checkered history
Check it again against your list n' see consistency
I never spent a cent that wasn't mine
You sent the dogs after my scent, that's fine
Yes, I have reasons for shame
But I have not committed treason and sullied my good name
As you can see I have done nothing to provoke legal action
Are my answers to your satisfaction?

Jefferson:
My God

Madison:
Gentlemen, let's go

Hamilton:
So?

Jefferson and Madison:
The people won't know what we know

Hamilton:
Burr!
How do I know you won't use this against me
The next time we go toe to toe?

Burr:
Alexander, rumors only grow
And we both know what we know
Hamilton:
In the eye of a hurricane
There is quiet
For just a moment
A yellow sky
When I was seventeen a hurricane
Destroyed my town
I didn't drown
I couldn't seem to die
I wrote my way out
Wrote everything down far as I could see
I wrote my way out
I looked up and the town had its eyes on me
They passed a plate around
Total strangers
Moved to kindness by my story
Raised enough for me to book passage on a
Ship that was New York bound…
I wrote my way out of hell
I wrote my way to revolution
I was louder than the crack in the bell
I wrote Eliza love letters until she fell
I wrote about The Constitution and defended it well
And in the face of ignorance and resistance
I wrote financial systems into existence
And when my prayers to God were met with indifference
I picked up a pen, I wrote my own deliverance
In the eye of a hurricane
There is quiet
For just a moment
A yellow sky
I was twelve when my mother died
She was holding me
We were sick and she was holding me
I couldn't seem to die

Burr:
Wait for it, wait for it, wait for it…

Hamilton:
I'll write my way out…

Burr and Ensemble:
Wait for it, wait for it, wait for it…

Hamilton:
Write ev'rything down, far as I can see…

Burr and Ensemble:
Wait for it, wait for it, wait for it, wait… (History has its eyes on you)

Hamilton:
I'll write my way out…
Overwhelm them with honesty
This is the eye of the hurricane, this is the only
Way I can protect my legacy…

Company (Except Hamilton):
Wait for it, wait for it, wait for it, wait…

Jefferson/Madison/Angelica:
Have you read this?

Burr/Jefferson/Madison:
Alexander Hamilton had a torrid affair
And he wrote it down right there

Madison:
Highlights!

Hamilton/Jefferson:
The charge against me
Is a connection with one
(With James: James Reynolds!)
For purposes of
Improper speculation
(With Burr: My real crime is an amorous connection with his wife)
For a considerable time
With his knowing consent

Madison/Burr/Jefferson:
Damn!

Hamilton/Jefferson/Madison:
"I had frequent meetings with her
Most of them at my own house."

Burr:
At his own house!

Madison:
At his own house!

Deep voice:
Damn!

Hamilton/Jefferson:
"Mrs. Hamilton with our children being absent
On a visit to her father."

Madison/Burr:
No…

Company:
Boooo!

Madison/Burr:
Have you read this?

Jefferson:
Well, he's never gon' be President now

Madison/Burr:
Never gon' be President now

Jefferson:
Well, he's never gon' be President now

Madison/Burr:
Never gon' be President now

Jefferson:
He's never gon' be President now

Madison/Burr:
Never gon' be President now

Angelica:
I came as soon as I heard

Jefferson:
What?!

Hamilton:
Angelica

Company:
All the way from London?!
Damn

Hamilton:
Angelica, thank God
Someone who understands what I'm struggling here to do

Angelica:
I'm not here for you

Ensemble:
Oooooh!

Angelica:
I know my sister like I know my own mind
You will never find anyone as trusting or as kind
I love my sister more than anything in this life
I will choose her happiness over mine every time
Put what we had aside
I'm standing at her side
You could never be satisfied
God, I hope you're satisfied

Jefferson/Madison/Burr (Ensemble Men):
He's never gon' be President now
(Never gon' be President now)
He's never gon' be President now

He's never gon' be President now
(Never gon' be President now)

Jefferson/Madison: Hey! At Least He Was Honest With Our Money! (Hamilton: Hey! At Least I Was Honest With Our Money!)
He's never gon' be President now (He's never gon' be President now)
He's never gon' be President now (He's never gon' be President now)

The Reynolds Pamphlet

Jefferson/Madison/Burr:
Have you read this?
You ever see somebody ruin their own life?

Company (except Hamilton/Eliza):
His poor wife

Eliza:
I saved every letter you wrote me
From the moment I read them
I knew you were mine
You said you were mine
I thought you were mine
Do you know what Angelica said
When we saw your first letter arrive?
She said, "Be careful with that one, love.
He will do what it takes to survive."
You and your words flooded my senses
Your sentences left me defenseless
You built me palaces out of paragraphs
You built cathedrals
I'm re-reading the letters you wrote me
I'm searching and scanning for answers
In every line
For some kind of sign
And when you were mine
The world seemed to burn, burn
You published the letters she wrote you
You told the whole world how you brought
This girl into our bed
In clearing your name, you have ruined our lives
Do you know what Angelica said
When she read what you'd done?
She said, "You've married an Icarus.
He has flown too close to the sun."
You and your words, obsessed with your legacy...
Your sentences border on senseless
And you are paranoid in every paragraph
How they perceive you
You, you, you…
I'm erasing myself from the narrative
Let future historians wonder
How Eliza reacted when you broke her heart
You have torn it all apart
I'm watching it burn
Watching it burn
The world has no right to my heart
The world has no place in our bed
They don't get to know what I said
I'm burning the memories
Burning the letters that might have redeemed you
You forfeit all rights to my heart
You forfeit the place in our bed
You'll sleep in your office instead
With only the memories
Of when you were mine
I hope that you burn

Philip:
Meet the latest graduate of King's College!
I prob'ly shouldn't brag, but, dag, I amaze and astonish!
The scholars say I got the same virtuosity and brains as my pops!
The ladies say my brain's not where the resemblance stops!
I'm only nineteen but my mind is older
Gotta be my own man, like my father, but bolder
I shoulder his legacy with pride
I used to hear him say
That someday I would

Ensemble:
Blow us all away

Philip:
Ladies, I'm looking for a Mr. George Eacker
Made a speech last week, our Fourth of July speaker
He disparaged my father's legacy in front of a crowd
I can't have that, I'm making my father proud

Martha:
I saw him just up Broadway a couple of blocks
He was goin' to see a play

Philip:
Well, I'll go visit his box

Dolly:
God, you're a fox

Philip:
And y'all look pretty good in ya' frocks
How 'bout when I get back, we all strip down to our socks?

Both:
OK!

Company:
Blow us all away!

Philip:
George!

George:
Shh

Philip:
George!

George:
Shh! I'm tryin' to watch the show!

Philip:
Ya' shoulda watched your mouth before you talked about my father though!

George:
I didn't say anything that wasn't true
Your father's a scoundrel, and so, it seems, are you

Ensemble:
Ooooooooooh!

Philip:
It's like that?

George:
Yeah, I don't fool around
I'm not your little schoolboy friends

Philip:
See you on the dueling ground
That is, unless you wanna step outside and go now

George:
I know where to find you, piss off
I'm watchin' this show now
Shh

Philip:
Pops, if you had only heard the shit he said about you
I doubt you would have let it slide and I was not about to

Hamilton:
Slow down

Philip:
I came to ask you for advice
This is my very first duel
They don't exactly cover this subject in boarding school

Hamilton:
Did your friends attempt to negotiate a peace?

Philip:
He refused to apologize, we had to let the peace talks cease

Hamilton:
Where is this happening?

Philip:
Across the river, in Jersey

Hamilton/Philip:
Everything is legal in New Jersey…

Hamilton:
Alright
So this is what you're gonna do:
Stand there like a man until Eacker is in front of you
When the time comes, fire your weapon in the air
This will put an end to the whole affair

Philip:
But what if he decides to shoot?
Then I'm a goner

Hamilton:
No, he'll follow suit if he's truly a man of honor
To take someone's life, that is something you can't shake
Philip, your mother can't take another heartbreak

Philip:
Father

Hamilton:
Promise me
You don't want this
Young man's blood on your conscience

Philip:
Okay, I promise

Hamilton:
Come back home when you're done
Take my guns, be smart
Make me proud, son

Philip:
My name is Philip
I am a poet
And I'm a little nervous, but I can't show it
I'm sorry, I'm a Hamilton with pride
You talk about my father, I cannot let it slide
Mister Eacker! How was the rest of your show?

George:
I'd rather skip the pleasantries
Let's go
Grab your pistol

Philip:
Confer with your men
The duel will commence after we count to ten

Ensemble:
Count to ten!

Philip:
Look 'em in the eye, aim no higher
Summon all the courage you require
Then slowly and clearly aim your gun towards the sky

Where's my son?

Doctor:
Mr. Hamilton, come in
They brought him in a half an hour ago
He lost a lot of blood on the way over

Ensemble Women:
Stay alive...

Hamilton:
Is he alive?

Doctor:
Yes. But you have to understand
The bullet entered just above his hip and
Lodged in his right arm

Hamilton:
Can I see him please?

Doctor:
I'm doing ev'rything I can, but the wound was
Already infected when he arrived

Hamilton:
Philip

Philip:
Pa
I did exactly as you said, Pa
I held my head up high

Hamilton (Philip):
I know, I know. Shh
I know, I know (High)
Shh. I know you did
Ev'rything just right
(Even before we got to ten)
Shh
(I was aiming for the sky)
I know, I know
I know, I know (I was aiming for the sky)

Save your strength and (With Ensemble Men: stay alive…)

Eliza:
No!

Eliza:
Is he breathing? Is he going to survive this?

Stay alive...

Eliza:
Who did this, Alexander, did you know?

Philip:
Mom, I'm so sorry for forgetting what you taught me

Eliza:
My son

Philip:
We played piano

Eliza:
I taught you piano

Philip:
You would put your hands on mine

Eliza:
You changed the melody every time

Philip:
Ha, I would always change the line

Eliza:
Shh. I know, I know

Philip:
I would always change the line

Eliza:
I know, I know

Angelica:
There are moments that the words don't reach
There is suffering too terrible to name
You hold your child as tight as you can
And push away the unimaginable
The moments when you're in so deep
It feels easier to just swim down

Angelica/Ensemble:
The Hamiltons move uptown
And learn to live with the unimaginable

Hamilton:
I spend hours in the garden
I walk alone to the store
And it's quiet uptown
I never liked the quiet before
I take the children to church on Sunday
A sign of the cross at the door
And I pray
That never used to happen before

Angelica and women:
If you see him in the street, walking by
Himself, talking to himself, have pity

Hamilton:
Philip, you would like it uptown
It's quiet uptown

Angelica and women:
He is working through the unimaginable

All men (except Hamilton):
His hair has gone grey. He passes every day
They say he walks the length of the city

Hamilton:
You knock me out, I fall apart

Company (except Hamilton and Eliza):
Can you imagine?

Hamilton:
Look at where we are
Look at where we started
I know I don't deserve you, Eliza
But hear me out. That would be enough
If I could spare his life
If I could trade his life for mine
He'd be standing here right now
And you would smile, and that would be enough
I don't pretend to know
The challenges we're facing
I know there's no replacing what we've lost
And you need time
But I'm not afraid
I know who I married
Just let me stay here by your side
That would be enough

Company (except Hamilton and Eliza):
If you see him in the street, walking by her
Side, talking by her side, have pity

Hamilton:
Eliza, do you like it uptown? It's quiet uptown

Company (except Hamilton and Eliza):
He is trying to do the unimaginable
See them walking in the park, long after dark
Taking in the sights of the city

Hamilton:
Look around, look around, Eliza

Company (except Hamilton and Eliza):
They are trying to do the unimaginable

Angelica:
There are moments that the words don't reach
There is a grace too powerful to name
We push away what we can never understand
We push away the unimaginable
They are standing in the garden
Alexander by Eliza's side
She takes his hand

Eliza:
It's quiet uptown

Company (except Hamilton and Eliza):
Forgiveness. Can you imagine?
Forgiveness. Can you imagine?
If you see him in the street, walking by her
Side, talking by her side, have pity
They are going through the unimaginable

Full company:
The election of 1800

Jefferson:
Can we get back to politics?

Madison:
Please?

Jefferson:
Yo. Ev'ry action has its equal, opposite reaction
John Adams shat the bed. I love the guy, but he's in traction
Poor Alexander Hamilton? He is missing in action
So now I'm facing

Jefferson and Madison:
Aaron Burr!

Jefferson:
With his own faction

Madison:
He's very attractive in the North
New Yorkers like his chances

Jefferson:
He's not very forthcoming on any particular stances

Madison:
Ask him a question: it glances off, he obfuscates, he dances

Jefferson:
And they say I'm a Francophile: at least they know I know where France is!

Madison:
Thomas that's the problem, see, they see Burr as a less extreme you

Jefferson:
Ha!

Madison:
You need to change course, a key endorsement might redeem you

Jefferson:
Who did you have in mind?

Madison:
Don't laugh

Jefferson:
Who is it?

Madison:
You used to work on the same staff

Jefferson:
Whaaaat

Madison:
It might be nice, it might be nice
To get Hamilton on your side

Jefferson and Madison:
It might be nice, it might be nice
To get Hamilton on your side

Burr (Ensemble):
Talk less!
(Burr!)
Smile more!
(Burr!)
Don't let 'em know what you're against or what you're for!
(Burr!)
Shake hands with him!
(Burr!)
Charm her!
(Burr!)
It's eighteen hundred, ladies, tell your husbands: vote for
Burr! (Burr!)

Male voter:
I don't like Adams

Female voter:
Well, he's gonna lose, that's just defeatist

Another male voter:
And Jefferson

Two men:
In love with France!

Another female voter:
Yeah, he's so elitist!

Two women:
I like that Aaron Burr!

A woman:
I can't believe we're here with him!

A man:
He seems approachable…?

Another male voter:
Like you could grab a beer with him!

Ensemble:
Dear Mr. Hamilton: your fellow Fed'ralists would like to know how you'll be voting

Hamilton:
It's quiet uptown

Ensemble:
Dear Mr. Hamilton: John Adams doesn't stand a chance, so who are you promoting?

Hamilton:
It's quiet uptown

Men (women):
Jefferson or Burr?
(Jefferson or Burr?)
We know it's lose-lose (We know it's lose-lose)
Jefferson or Burr?
(Jefferson or Burr?)
But if you had to choose (But if you had to choose)
Dear Mr. Hamilton: (Jefferson or Burr?)
John Adams doesn't stand a chance (We know it's lose-lose)
So who are you promoting? (Jefferson or Burr?)
But if you had to choose (But if you had to choose)

Hamilton:
Well, if it isn't Aaron Burr. Sir!

Burr:
Alexander!

Hamilton:
You've created quite a stir, sir!

Burr:
I'm going door to door!

Hamilton:
You're openly campaigning?

Burr:
Sure!

Hamilton:
That's new

Burr:
Honestly, it's kind of draining

Hamilton:
Burr

Burr:
Sir!

Hamilton:
Is there anything you wouldn't do?

Burr:
No, I'm chasing what I want
And you know what?

Hamilton:
What?

Burr:
I learned that from you

Ensemble:
If you had to choose
If you had to choose

Madison:
It's a tie!

Ensemble:
If you had to choose
If you had to choose

Jefferson:
It's up to the delegates!

Ensemble:
If you had to choose
If you had to choose

Jefferson/Madison:
It's up to Hamilton!

Voters (Madison/Ensemble):
If you had to choose

Hamilton:
Yo

Ensemble:
Oh!

Hamilton:
The people are asking to hear my voice

Ensemble:
Oh!

Hamilton:
For the country is facing a difficult choice

Ensemble:
Oh!

Hamilton:
And if you were to ask me who I'd promote

Ensemble:
Oh!

Hamilton:
Jefferson has my vote

Jefferson/Madison/Ensemble:
Oh!

Hamilton:
I have never agreed with Jefferson once

Jefferson/Madison/Ensemble:
Oh!

Hamilton:
We have fought on like seventy-five diff'rent fronts

Jefferson/Madison/Ensemble:
Oh!

Hamilton:
But when all is said and all is done
Jefferson has beliefs, Burr has none

Ensemble:
Oooooooooooooh

Madison and Jefferson:
Well, I'll be damned
Well, I'll be damned

Madison:
Hamilton's on your side

Ensemble:
Well, I'll be damned
Well, I'll be damned

Jefferson:
And?

Madison:
You won in a landslide

Burr:
Congrats on a race well-run
I did give you a fight

Jefferson:
Uh-huh

Burr:
I look forward to our partnership

Jefferson:
Our partnership?

Burr:
As your vice-President

Jefferson:
Ha. Yeah, right
You hear this guy? Man openly campaigns against me, talkin' bout, "I look forward to our partnership."

Madison:
It's crazy that the guy who comes in second gets to be Vice President

Jefferson:
Yeah, you know what? We can change that. You know why?

Madison:
Why?

Jefferson:
'Cause I'm the President
Burr, when you see Hamilton, thank him for the endorsement
Burr:
How does Hamilton
An arrogant
Immigrant, orphan
Bastard, whoreson
Somehow endorse
Thomas Jefferson, his enemy
A man he's despised since the beginning
Just to keep me from winning?
I wanna be in the room where it happens

Burr and Company:
The room where it happens
The room where it happens

Burr:
You've kept me from

Burr and Company:
The room where it happens

Burr:
For the last time
Dear Alexander:
I am slow to anger
But I toe the line
As I reckon with the effects
Of your life on mine
I look back on where I failed
And in every place I checked
The only common thread has been your disrespect
Now you call me "amoral,"
A "dangerous disgrace,"
If you've got something to say
Name a time and place
Face to face
I have the honor to be your obedient servant
A dot Burr

Hamilton:
Mr. Vice President:
I am not the reason no one trusts you
No one knows what you believe
I will not equivocate on my opinion
I have always worn it on my sleeve
Even if I said what you think I said
You would need to cite a more specific grievance
Here's an itemized list of thirty years of disagreements

Burr:
Sweet Jesus

Hamilton:
Hey, I have not been shy
I am just a guy in the public eye
Tryin' to do my best for our republic
I don't wanna fight
But I won't apologize for doing what's right
I have the honor to be your obedient servant
A dot Ham

Burr:
Careful how you proceed, good man
Intemperate indeed, good man
Answer for the accusations I lay at your feet or
Prepare to bleed, good man

Hamilton:
Burr, your grievance is legitimate
I stand by what I said, every bit of it
You stand only for yourself
It's what you do
I can't apologize because it's true

Burr:
Then stand, Alexander
Weehawken. Dawn
Guns. Drawn

Hamilton:
You're on

Burr and Hamilton:
I have the honor to be your obedient servant

Hamilton:
A dot Ham

Burr:
A dot Burr

Eliza:
Alexander, come back to sleep

Hamilton:
I have an early meeting out of town

Eliza:
It's still dark outside

Hamilton:
I know. I just need to write something down

Eliza:
Why do you write like you're running out of time?

Hamilton:
Shhh

Eliza:
Come back to bed. That would be enough

Hamilton:
I'll be back before you know I'm gone

Eliza:
Come back to sleep

Hamilton:
This meeting's at dawn

Eliza:
Well, I'm going back to sleep

Hamilton:
Hey. Best of wives and best of women

Male Company:
One two three four

Full Company (except Hamilton and Burr):
Five six seven eight nine

Burr:
There are ten things you need to know

Company:
Number one!

Burr:
We rowed across the Hudson at dawn
My friend, William P. Van Ness signed on as my

Burr and Company:
Number two!

Burr:
Hamilton arrived with his crew:
Nathaniel Pendleton and a doctor that he knew

Company:
Number three!

Burr:
I watched Hamilton examine the terrain
I wish I could tell you what was happ'ning in his brain
This man has poisoned my political pursuits!

Company:
Most disputes die and no one shoots!
Number four!

Burr:
Hamilton drew first position
Looking, to the world, like a man on a mission
This is a soldier with a marksman's ability
The doctor turned around so he could have deniability

Company:
Five!

Burr:
Now I didn't know this at the time
But we were

Burr and Philip (Hamilton):
Near the same spot (Near the same spot)
Your son died, is that why (My son died, is that why)

Company:
Six!

Burr:
He examined his gun with such rigor?
I watched as he methodically fiddled with the trigger

Company:
Seven!

Burr:
Confession time? Here's what I got:
My fellow soldiers'll tell you I'm a terrible shot

Company:
Number eight!

Burr/Hamilton/Ensemble men:
Your last chance to negotiate
Send in your seconds, see if they can set the record straight

Burr:
They won't teach you this in your classes
But look it up, Hamilton was wearing his glasses
Why? If not to take deadly aim?
It's him or me, the world will never be the same
I had only one thought before the slaughter:
This man will not make an orphan of my daughter

Company:
Number nine!

Burr:
Look him in the eye, aim no higher
Summon all the courage you require
Then count:

Company:
One two three four five six seven eight nine
Number ten paces! Fire!

Hamilton:
I imagine death so much it feels more like a memory
Is this where it gets me, on my feet, sev'ral feet ahead of me?
I see it coming, do I run or fire my gun or let it be?
There is no beat, no melody
Burr, my first friend, my enemy
Maybe the last face I ever see
If I throw away my shot, is this how you'll remember me?
What if this bullet is my legacy?
Legacy. What is a legacy?
It's planting seeds in a garden you never get to see
I wrote some notes at the beginning of a song someone will sing for me
America, you great unfinished symphony, you sent for me
You let me make a difference
A place where even orphan immigrants
Can leave their fingerprints and rise up
I'm running out of time. I'm running, and my time's up
Wise up. Eyes up
I catch a glimpse of the other side
Laurens leads a soldiers' chorus on the other side
My son is on the other side
He's with my mother on the other side
Washington is watching from the other side
Teach me how to say goodbye
Rise up, rise up, rise up
Eliza
My love, take your time
I'll see you on the other side
Raise a glass to freedom...

Burr and Company:
He aims his pistol at the sky

Burr:
Wait!
I strike him right between his ribs
I walk towards him, but I am ushered away
They row him back across the Hudson
I get a drink

Company:
Aaaah
Aaaah
Aaaah

Burr:
I hear wailing in the streets

Company:
Aaaah
Aaaah
Aaaah

Burr:
Somebody tells me, "You'd better hide."

Company:
Aaaah
Aaaah
Aaaah

Burr:
They say

Burr and Angelica:
Angelica and Eliza

Burr:
Were both at his side when he died
Death doesn't discriminate
Between the sinners and the saints
It takes and it takes and it takes
History obliterates
In every picture it paints
It paints me and all my mistakes
When Alexander aimed at the sky
He may have been the first one to die
But I'm the one who paid for it
I survived, but I paid for it
Now I'm the villain in your history
I was too young and blind to see...
I should've known
I should've known the world was wide enough for both Hamilton and me
The world was wide enough for both Hamilton and me

Washington:
Let me tell you what I wish I'd known
When I was young and dreamed of glory
You have no control:

Washington and Company:
Who lives
Who dies
Who tells your story?

Burr:
President Jefferson:

Jefferson:
I'll give him this: his financial system is a work of genius
I couldn't undo it if I tried
And I tried

Washington and Company:
Who lives
Who dies
Who tells your story?

Burr:
President Madison:

Madison:
He took our country from bankruptcy to prosperity
I hate to admit it, but he doesn't get enough credit for all the credit he gave us

Washington and Company:
Who lives
Who dies
Who tells your story?

Angelica:
Every other founding father's story gets told
Every other founding father gets to grow old

Burr:
But when you're gone, who remembers your name?
Who keeps your flame?

Burr and men (Angelica and women):
Who tells your story?
(Who tells your story?)
Who tells your story? (Your story?)

Women:
Eliza

Eliza:
I put myself back in the narrative

Women:
Eliza

Eliza:
I stop wasting time on tears
I live another fifty years
It's not enough

Company:
Eliza

Eliza:
I interview every soldier who fought by your side

Mulligan/Lafayette/Laurens:
She tells our story

Eliza:
I try to make sense of your thousands of pages of writings
You really do write like you're running out of

Eliza and Company:
Time

Eliza:
I rely on

Eliza and Angelica:
Angelica

Eliza:
While she's alive

Eliza and Angelica:
We tell your story

Eliza:
She is buried in Trinity Church

Eliza and Angelica:
Near you

Eliza:
When I needed her most, she was right on

Eliza and Company:
Time

Eliza:
And I'm still not through
I ask myself, "What would you do if you had more?"

Eliza and Company:
Time

Eliza:
The Lord, in his kindness
He gives me what you always wanted
He gives me more

Eliza and Company:
Time

Eliza:
I raise funds in D.C. for the Washington Monument

Washington:
She tells my story

Eliza:
I speak out against slavery
You could have done so much more if you only had

Eliza and Company:
Time

Eliza:
And when my time is up, have I done enough?

Eliza and Company:
Will they tell our story?

Eliza:
Oh. Can I show you what I'm proudest of?

Company:
The orphanage

Eliza:
I established the first private orphanage in New York City

Company:
The orphanage

Eliza:
I help to raise hundreds of children
I get to see them growing up

Company:
The orphanage

Eliza:
In their eyes I see you, Alexander
I see you every

Eliza and Company:
Time

Eliza:
And when my time is up
Have I done enough?

Eliza and Company:
Will they tell our story?

Eliza:
Oh, I can't wait to see you again
It's only a matter of

Eliza and Company:
Time

Company:
Will they tell your story?
(Time…)
Who lives, who dies, who tells your story?
(Time…)
Will they tell your story?
(Time…)
Who lives, who dies

Full Company:
Who tells your story?
